We identify appropriate conditions on the likelihood distribution and the prior measure which guarantee existence, uniqueness and stability of the posterior measure with respect to perturbations of the data. We also consider convergence of numerical approximations of the posterior given a consistent discretization.

abstract = {Modelling transcriptional regulation provides amazing challenges that encourage the convergence between mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, medical care, electronics instrumentation and computer science. One of the most challenging features that mod- elling transcriptional regulation provides is to establish how protein expression levels and messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) expression levels interact to provide a robust process that ensures function within a living cell. In the work presented in this dissertation, the Bicoid protein expression level and the Bicoid mRNA expression level are described using a reaction-diffusion PDE (Partial Differential Equation) based mechanistic model integrated with protein expression data available from FlyEx database using Gaussian processes. The problem reported in this document consists in inferring the mRNA expression level using available data from protein expression profiles (Temporal Profiles), specifically from Bicoid protein. This work presents a methodology based on Gaussian processes regression models effec- tively combined with mechanistic models based on partial differential equations. Assum- ing that the mRNA expression levels and the protein expression levels are jointly gaussian and that both are related through a partial differential equation, given data from the protein expression profiles, inference can be made upon the mRNA expression level by estimating the parameters of the posterior Gaussian process distribution. In addition to this, in available literature, the problem reported in this document was approached using ordinary differential equations and discretized partial differential equations. Thev novel methodology proposed, deals with the problem using the complete solution for a partial differential equation based on Green and Heaviside boundary functions, hence considering the propagation of the excitation in the spatio-temporal domain. The results reported in this document show that the proposed methodology over per- forms other available methodologies in current literature, obatining better estimations for the output regression in the temporal domain and enhancing error metrics with re- spect to available literature in the spatial domain. With regards to latent force inference, the results obtained showed an extremely close approximation with respect to the decay rate profile in the mRNA expression level, in contrast with the stability regulation pro- file, that is poorly approximated when using only one test point in the training process. However, when including five test points in the training process, the inferred latent force approaches the expected theoretical value better than any other reported in available literature. In addition to this, when using three test points in the training process, the stability regulation value is also very well approximated but its duration is shorter than the expected theoretical value. From the work done, it was shown that the model proposed reproduces the output regression in the spatial domain with a very good precision, reproduces the output re- gression in the temporal domain with acceptable precision and infers the latent force, that is, the mRNA expression level with very good precision when training with five test points and with one test point the precision diminishes when inferring the stability regulation profile whilst the precision inferring the decay rate remains the same.},

abstract = {Standard MCMC methods can scale poorly to big data settings due to the need to evaluate the likelihood at each iteration. There have been a number of approximate MCMC algorithms that use sub-sampling ideas to reduce this computational burden, but with the drawback that these algorithms no longer target the true posterior distribution. We introduce a new family of Monte Carlo methods based upon a multi-dimensional version of the Zig-Zag process of (Bierkens, Roberts, 2016), a continuous time piecewise deterministic Markov process. While traditional MCMC methods are reversible by construction the Zig-Zag process offers a flexible non-reversible alternative. The dynamics of the Zig-Zag process correspond to a constant velocity model, with the velocity of the process switching at events from a point process. The rate of this point process can be related to the invariant distribution of the process. If we wish to target a given posterior distribution, then rates need to be set equal to the gradient of the log of the posterior. Unlike traditional MCMC, We show how the Zig-Zag process can be simulated without discretisation error, and give conditions for the process to be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a sub-sampling version of the Zig-Zag process that is an example of an exact approximate scheme. That is, if we replace the true gradient of the log posterior with an unbiased estimator, obtained by sub-sampling, then the resulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary distribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the variance of our unbiased estimator, then both heuristic arguments and empirical observations show that Zig-Zag can be super-efficient: after an initial pre-processing step, essentially independent samples from the posterior distribution are obtained at a computational cost which does not depend on the size of the data.},

abstract = {We address the numerical solution of infinite-dimensional inverse problems in the framework of Bayesian inference. In the Part I companion to this paper (arXiv.org:1308.1313), we considered the linearized infinite-dimensional inverse problem. Here in Part II, we relax the linearization assumption and consider the fully nonlinear infinite-dimensional inverse problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. To address the challenges of sampling high-dimensional pdfs arising from Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs, we build on the stochastic Newton MCMC method. This method exploits problem structure by taking as a proposal density a local Gaussian approximation of the posterior pdf, whose construction is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of its data misfit component of the Hessian. Here we introduce an approximation of the stochastic Newton proposal in which we compute the low-rank-based Hessian at just the MAP point, and then reuse this Hessian at each MCMC step. We compare the performance of the proposed method to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to an independence sampler. The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice sheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with a MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic Newton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian at each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the independence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and thus overall it is much cheaper. Finally, we present extensive analysis and interpretation of the posterior distribution, and classify directions in parameter space based on the extent to which they are informed by the prior or the observations.},

In practice, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms often are used to draw samples from the posterior distribution. However, implementations of such algorithms can be computationally expensive. We present a computationally efficient scheme for sampling high-dimensional Gaussian distributions in ill-posed Bayesian linear inverse problems. Our approach uses Metropolis-Hastings independence sampling with a proposal distribution based on a low-rank approximation of the prior-preconditioned Hessian. We show the dependence of the acceptance rate on the number of eigenvalues retained and discuss conditions under which the acceptance rate is high.

abstract = {In this article we consider the approximation of expectations w.r.t. probability distributions associated to the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs); this scenario appears routinely in Bayesian inverse problems. In practice, one often has to solve the associated PDE numerically, using, for instance finite element methods which depend on the step-size level hL. In addition, the expectation cannot be computed analytically and one often resorts to Monte Carlo methods. In the context of this problem, it is known that the introduction of the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method can reduce the amount of computational effort to estimate expectations, for a given level of error. This is achieved via a telescoping identity associated to a Monte Carlo approximation of a sequence of probability distributions with discretization levels ∞{\textgreater}h0{\textgreater}h1⋯{\textgreater}hL. In many practical problems of interest, one cannot achieve an i.i.d. sampling of the associated sequence and a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) version of the MLMC method is introduced to deal with this problem. It is shown that under appropriate assumptions, the attractive property of a reduction of the amount of computational effort to estimate expectations, for a given level of error, can be maintained within the SMC context. That is, relative to exact sampling and Monte Carlo for the distribution at the finest level hL. The approach is numerically illustrated on a Bayesian inverse problem.},

This theorem enables us to identify appropriate conditions on the forward solution operator which imply the well-definedness and well-posedness of the posterior measure, and to match the prior Besov measure to these conditions.

abstract = {We present and study a Langevin MCMC approach for sampling nonlinear diffusion bridges. The method is based on recent theory concerning stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) reversible with respect to the target bridge, derived by applying the Langevin idea on the bridge pathspace. In the process, a Random-Walk Metropolis algorithm and an Independence Sampler are also obtained. The novel algorithmic idea of the paper is that proposed moves for the MCMC algorithm are determined by discretising the SPDEs in the time direction using an implicit scheme, parametrised by theta is an element of [0,1]. We show that the resulting infinite-dimensional MCMC sampler is well-defined only if theta = 1/2, when the MCMC proposals have the correct quadratic variation. Previous Langevin-based MCMC methods used explicit schemes, corresponding to. = 0. The significance of the choice theta = 1/2 is inherited by the finite-dimensional approximation of the algorithm used in practice. We present numerical results illustrating the phenomenon and the theory that explains it. Diffusion bridges (with additive noise) are representative of the family of laws defined as a change of measure from Gaussian distributions on arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces; the analysis in this paper can be readily extended to target laws from this family and an example from signal processing illustrates this fact.},

abstract = {Based on the lecture notes of the autumn school Modellierung und Optimierung mit Partiellen Differentialgleichungen, which was held in Sept. 2005 at the Universität Hamburg. This book presents a modern introduction of pde constrained optimization. It provides a precise functional analytic treatment via optimality conditions and a state-of-the-art, non-smooth algorithmical framework. Furthermore, new structure-exploiting discrete concepts and large scale, practically relevant applications are presented. The main focus is on the algorithmical and numerical treatment of pde constrained optimization problems on the infinite dimensional level. A particular emphasis is on simple constraints, such as pointwise bounds on controls and states. For these practically important situations, tailored Newton- and SQP-type solution algorithms are proposed and a general convergence framework is developed. This is complemented with the numerical analysis of structure-preserving Galerkin schemes for optimization problems with elliptic and parabolic equations. Finally, along with the optimization of semiconductor devices and the optimization of glass cooling processes, two challenging applications of pde constrained optimization are presented. They demonstrate the scope of this emerging research field for future engineering applications.

abstract = {The computational complexity of MCMC methods for the exploration of complex probability measures is a challenging and important problem. A challenge of particular importance arises in Bayesian inverse problems where the target distribution may be supported on an infinite dimensional space. In practice this involves the approximation of measures defined on sequences of spaces of increasing dimension. Motivated by an elliptic inverse problem with non-Gaussian prior, we study the design of proposal chains for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with dimension independent performance. Dimension-independent bounds on the Monte-Carlo error of MCMC sampling for Gaussian prior measures have already been established. In this paper we provide a simple recipe to obtain these bounds for non-Gaussian prior measures. To illustrate the theory we consider an elliptic inverse problem arising in groundwater flow. We explicitly construct an efficient Metropolis-Hastings proposal based on local proposals, and we provide numerical evidence which supports the theory.},

abstract = {A key problem in inference for high dimensional unknowns is the design of sampling algorithms whose performance scales favourably with the dimension of the unknown. A typical setting in which these problems arise is the area of Bayesian inverse problems. In such problems, which include graph-based learning, nonparametric regression and PDE-based inversion, the unknown can be viewed as an infinite-dimensional parameter (such as a function) that has been discretised. This results in a high-dimensional space for inference. Here we study robustness of an MCMC algorithm for posterior inference; this refers to MCMC convergence rates that do not deteriorate as the discretisation becomes finer. When a Gaussian prior is employed there is a known methodology for the design of robust MCMC samplers. However, one often requires more flexibility than a Gaussian prior can provide: hierarchical models are used to enable inference of parameters underlying a Gaussian prior; or non-Gaussian priors, such as Besov, are employed to induce sparse MAP estimators; or deep Gaussian priors are used to represent other non-Gaussian phenomena; and piecewise constant functions, which are necessarily non-Gaussian, are required for classification problems. The purpose of this article is to show that the simulation technology available for Gaussian priors can be exported to such non-Gaussian priors. The underlying methodology is based on a white noise representation of the unknown. This is exploited both for robust posterior sampling and for joint inference of the function and parameters involved in the specification of its prior, in which case our framework borrows strength from the well-developed non-centred methodology for Bayesian hierarchical models. The desired robustness of the proposed sampling algorithms is supported by some theory and by extensive numerical evidence from several challenging problems.},

abstract = {Bayesian inverse problems often involve sampling posterior distributions on infinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon mesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more accurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the discretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension. Recently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times has emerged. However, few of them take into account the geometry of the posterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric MCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated distributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are in general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite dimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional subspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective is to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the computational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla preconditioned Crank???Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas from geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic finite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while retaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods in the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the context of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat conduction and incompressible flow control. The algorithms exhibit up to two orders of magnitude improvement in sampling efficiency when compared with the pCN method.},

abstract = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems. We demonstrate that, when formulated in a Bayesian fashion, a wide range of inverse problems share a common mathematical framework, and we highlight a theory of well-posedness which stems from this. The well-posedness theory provides the basis for a number of stability and approximation results which we describe. We also review a range of algorithmic approaches which are used when adopting the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. These include MCMC methods, filtering and the variational approach.},

abstract = {In computational inverse problems, it is common that a detailed and accurate forward model is approximated by a computationally less challenging substitute. The model reduction may be necessary to meet constraints in computing time when optimization algorithms are used to find a single estimate, or to speed up Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) calculations in the Bayesian framework. The use of an approximate model introduces a discrepancy, or modeling error, that may have a detrimental effect on the solution of the ill-posed inverse problem, or it may severely distort the estimate of the posterior distribution. In the Bayesian paradigm, the modeling error can be considered as a random variable, and by using an estimate of the probability distribution of the unknown, one may estimate the probability distribution of the modeling error and incorporate it into the inversion. We introduce an algorithm which iterates this idea to update the distribution of the model error, leading to a sequence of posterior distributions that are demonstrated empiricially to capture the underlying truth with increasing accuracy. Since the algorithm is not based on rejections, it requires only limited full model evaluations. We show analytically that, in the linear Gaussian case, the algorithm converges geometrically fast with respect to the number of iterations. For more general models, we introduce particle approximations of the iteratively generated sequence of distributions; we also prove that each element of the sequence converges in the large particle limit. We show numerically that, as in the linear case, rapid convergence occurs with respect to the number of iterations. Additionally, we show through computed examples that point estimates obtained from this iterative algorithm are superior to those obtained by neglecting the model error.},

abstract = {Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R(0), epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R(0), turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.},

We prove a generalized polynomial chaos representation of the posterior density with respect to the prior measure, given noisy observational data. We analyze the sparsity of the posterior density in terms of the summability of the input data's coefficient sequence. To this end, we estimate the fluctuations in the prior.

For countably parametric, deterministic representations of uncertain parameters in the forward problem, which belong to a specified sparsity class, we quantify analytic regularity of the likewise countably parametric, deterministic Bayesian posterior density with respect to a uniform prior on the uncertain parameter sequences and prove that the parametric, deterministic density of the Bayesian posterior belongs to the same sparsity class. Generalizing C Schillings and C Schwab (2013 Inverse Problems 29 065011) and C Schwab and A M Stuart (2012 Inverse Problems 28 045003) the forward problems are converted to countably parametric, deterministic operator equations. Computational Bayesian inversion amounts to numerically evaluating expectations of quantities of interest (QoIs) under the Bayesian posterior, conditional on noisy observation data. Our results imply, on the one hand, sparsity of Legendre (generalized) polynomial chaos expansions of the density of theBayesian posterior with respect to uniform prior and, on the other hand, convergence rates for data-adaptive Smolyak integration algorithms for computational Bayesian estimation, which are independent of the dimension of the parameter space. We prove, mathematically and computationally, that for uncertain inputswith sufficient sparsity convergence rates are, in particular, superior to Markov chain Monte-Carlo sampling of the posterior, in terms of the number N of instances of the parametric forward problem to be solved.},

abstract = {The numerical discretization of problems with stochastic data or stochastic parameters generally involves the introduction of coordinates that describe the stochastic behavior, such as coefficients in a series expansion or values at discrete points. The series expansion of a Gaussian field with respect to any orthonormal basis of its Cameron–Martin space has independent stan- dard normal coefficients. A standard choice for numerical simulations is the Karhunen–Lo` eve series, which is based on eigenfunctions of the covariance op- erator. We suggest an alternative, the hierarchic discrete spectral expansion, which can be constructed directly from the covariance kernel. The resulting basis functions are often well localized, and the convergence of the series ex- pansion seems to be comparable to that of the Karhunen–Lo` eve series. We provide explicit formulas for particular cases, and general numerical methods for computing exact representations of such bases. Finally, we relate our ap- proach to numerical discretizations based on replacing a random field by its values on a finite set.},

The task of monitoring the liquid suspension can be posed as a time-evolving inverse problem and solved with Bayesian statistical methods. In this paper, we extend Bayesian methods to incorporate statistical models for the error that is incurred in the numerical solution of the physical governing equations. This enables full uncertainty quantification within a principled computation-precision trade-off, in contrast to the over-confident inferences that are obtained when numerical error is ignored. The method is cast with a sequential Monte Carlo framework and an optimised implementation is provided in Python.},

abstract = {Inverse problems are often ill posed, with solutions that depend sensitively on data. In any numerical approach to the solution of such problems, regularization of some form is needed to counteract the resulting instability. This paper is based on an approach to regularization, employing a Bayesian formulation of the problem, which leads to a notion of well posedness for inverse problems, at the level of probability measures. The stability which results from this well posedness may be used as the basis for quantifying the approximation, in finite dimensional spaces, of inverse problems for functions. This paper contains a theory which utilizes this stability property to estimate the distance between the true and approximate posterior distributions, in the Hellinger metric, in terms of error estimates for approximation of the underlying forward problem. This is potentially useful as it allows for the transfer of estimates from the numerical analysis of forward problems into estimates for the solution of the related inverse problem. It is noteworthy that, when the prior is a Gaussian random field model, controlling differences in the Hellinger metric leads to control on the differences between expected values of polynomially bounded functions and operators, including the mean and covariance operator. The ideas are applied to some non-Gaussian inverse problems where the goal is determination of the initial condition for the Stokes or Navier–Stokes equation from Lagrangian and Eulerian observations, respectively.

abstract = {We present a computational framework for estimating the uncertainty in the numerical solution of linearized infinite-dimensional statistical inverse problems. We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data and their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a prior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field, find the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior must be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the infinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the posterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to convergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally, solution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the covariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem as many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on the infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart (A. M. Stuart, Inverse problems: A Bayesian perspective, Acta Numerica, 19 (2010), pp. 451-559), and incorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent discretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem. The framework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior, constructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the posterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure scalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions. We demonstrate this computational framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse problem in 3D global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of thousands of parameters.},

We generalise these definitions to modes of arbitrary measures on topological vector spaces, defined by arbitrary bounded, convex, neighbour- hoods of the origin.

abstract = {We study the problem of sampling high and infinite dimensional target measures arising in applications such as conditioned diffusions and inverse problems. We focus on those that arise from approximating measures on Hilbert spaces defined via a density with respect to a Gaussian reference measure. We consider the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that adds an accept–reject mechanism to a Markov chain proposal in order to make the chain reversible with respect to the target measure. We focus on cases where the proposal is either a Gaussian random walk (RWM) with covariance equal to that of the reference measure or an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck proposal (pCN) for which the reference measure is invariant. Previous results in terms of scaling and diffusion limits suggested that the pCN has a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension while the RWM method has undesirable dimension-dependent behaviour. We confirm this claim by exhibiting a dimension-independent Wasserstein spectral gap for pCN algorithm for a large class of target measures. In our setting this Wasserstein spectral gap implies an L2 -spectral gap. We use both spectral gaps to show that the ergodic average satisfies a strong law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and nonasymptotic bounds on the mean square error, all dimension independent. In contrast we show that the spectral gap of the RWM algorithm applied to the reference measures degenerates as the dimension tends to infinity.},

The book presents a general mathematical formulation of RB methods, an-alyzes their fundamental theoretical properties, discusses the related algo-rithmic and implementation aspects, and highlights their built-in algebraic and geometric structures. More specifically, the authors discuss alternative strategies for construct-ing accurate RB spaces using greedy algorithms and proper orthogonal decomposition techniques, investigate their approximation properties and analyze offline-online decomposition strategies aimed at the reduction of computational complexity. Furthermore, they carry out both a priori and a posteriori error analysis. The whole mathematical presentation is made more stimulating by the use of representative examples of applicative interest in the context of both linear and nonlinear PDEs. Moreover, the inclusion of many pseudocodes allows the reader to easily implement the algorithms illustrated through-out the text. The book will be ideal for upper undergraduate students and, more generally, people interested in scientific computing.},

abstract = {We introduce a new family of MCMC samplers that combine auxiliary variables, Gibbs sampling and Taylor expansions of the target density. Our approach permits the marginalisation over the auxiliary variables yielding marginal samplers, or the augmentation of the auxiliary variables, yielding auxiliary samplers. The well-known Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm are shown to be special cases. We prove that marginal samplers are superior in terms of asymptotic variance and demonstrate cases where they are slower in computing time compared to auxiliary samplers. In the context of latent Gaussian models we propose new auxiliary and marginal samplers whose implementation requires a single tuning parameter, which can be found automatically during the transient phase. Extensive experimentation shows that the increase in efficiency (measured as effective sample size per unit of computing time) relative to (optimised implementations of) pCNL, elliptical slice sampling and MALA ranges from 10-fold in binary classification problems to 25-fold in log-Gaussian Cox processes to 100-fold in Gaussian process regression, and it is on par with Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in an example where the latter has the same complexity as the aforementioned algorithms. We explain this remarkable improvement in terms of the way alternative samplers try to approximate the eigenvalues of the target. We introduce a novel MCMC sampling scheme for hyperparameter learning that builds upon the auxiliary samplers. The MATLAB code for reproducing the experiments in the article is publicly available and a Supplement to this article contains additional experiments and implementation details.},

To this end, a family of dimensional independent MCMC algorithms, known as the preconditioned Crank–Nicolson (pCN) methods, were proposed to sample the infinite dimensional parameters. In this work we develop an adaptive version of the pCN algorithm, where the covariance operator of the proposal distribution is adjusted based on sampling history to improve the simulation efficiency.

In this note we determine the exact asymptotic order of these covering numbers, exploiting an explicit description of Gaussian RKHSs via orthonormal bases. We show that Zhou's estimate is almost sharp (up to a double logarithmic factor), but his conjecture on the correct asymptotic rate is far too optimistic.

abstract = {Many inverse problems involve the estimation of a high dimensional quantity, such as a function, from noisy indirect measurements. These problems have received much study from both classical and statistical directions, with each approach having its own advantages and disadvantages. In this thesis we focus on the Bayesian approach, in which all uncertainty is modelled probabilistically. Recently the Bayesian approach to inversion has been developed in function space. Much of the existing work in the area has been focused on the case when the prior distribution produces samples which are continuous functions, however it is of in- terest, both in terms of applications and mathematically, to consider cases when these samples are discontinuous. Natural applications are those in which we wish to infer the shape and locations of interfaces between different materials, such as in tomography. In this thesis we consider Bayesian inverse problems in which the unknown function is piecewise continuous or piecewise constant. Based on prior information, the prob- lem is then to infer the discontinuity set, the values the function takes away from the discontinuities, or both simultaneously. These problems are considered both from analytic and computational points of view. In order to ensure numerical robustness, we formulate any algorithms directly on function space before discretizing. This requires a number of technical issues to be considered, such as the equivalence and singularity of measures on such spaces.},

The goal of the OED problem is to find an optimal placement of sensors so as to minimize the uncertainty in the inferred parameter field. Specifically, we seek an optimal subset of sensors from among a fixed set of candidate sensor locations. We formulate the OED objective function by generalizing the classical A-optimal experimental design criterion using the expected value of the trace of the posterior covariance. This expected value is computed through sample averaging over the set of likely experimental data.

abstract = {Many problems arising in applications result in the need to probe a probability distribution for functions. Examples include Bayesian nonparametric statistics and conditioned diffusion processes. Standard MCMC algorithms typically become arbitrarily slow under the mesh refinement dictated by nonparametric description of the unknown function. We describe an approach to modifying a whole range of MCMC methods, applicable whenever the target measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, which ensures that their speed of convergence is robust under mesh refinement. Gaussian processes or random fields are fields whose marginal distributions, when evaluated at any finite set of {\$}N{\$} points, are {\$}\backslashbackslashmathbb{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}R{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\^{}}N{\$}-valued Gaussians. The algorithmic approach that we describe is applicable not only when the desired probability measure has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, but also to some useful non-Gaussian reference measures constructed through random truncation. In the applications of interest the data is often sparse and the prior specification is an essential part of the overall modelling strategy. These Gaussian-based reference measures are a very flexible modelling tool, finding wide-ranging application. Examples are shown in density estimation, data assimilation in fluid mechanics, subsurface geophysics and image registration. The key design principle is to formulate the MCMC method so that it is, in principle, applicable for functions; this may be achieved by use of proposals based on carefully chosen time-discretizations of stochastic dynamical systems which exactly preserve the Gaussian reference measure. Taking this approach leads to many new algorithms which can be implemented via minor modification of existing algorithms, yet which show enormous speed-up on a wide range of applied problems.},

abstract = {We provide a general methodology for unbiased estimation for intractable stochastic models. We consider situations where the target distribution can be written as an appropriate limit of distributions, and where conventional approaches require truncation of such a representation leading to a systematic bias. For example, the target distribution might be representable as the {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$}-limit of a basis expansion in a suitable Hilbert space; or alternatively the distribution of interest might be representable as the weak limit of a sequence of random variables, as in MCMC. Our main motivation comes from infinite-dimensional models which can be parame- terised in terms of a series expansion of basis functions (such as that given by a Karhunen-Loeve expansion). We consider schemes for direct unbiased estimation along such an expansion, as well as those based on MCMC schemes which, due to their dimensionality, cannot be directly imple- mented, but which can be effectively estimated unbiasedly. For all our methods we give theory to justify the numerical stability for robust Monte Carlo implementation, and in some cases we illustrate using simulations. Interestingly the computational efficiency of our methods is usually comparable to simpler methods which are biased. Crucial to the effectiveness of our proposed methodology is the construction of appropriate couplings, many of which resonate strongly with the Monte Carlo constructions used in the coupling from the past algorithm and its variants.},

abstract = {We consider the inverse problem of estimating the initial condition of a partial differential equation, which is only observed through noisy measurements at discrete time intervals. In particular, we focus on the case where Eulerian measurements are obtained from the time and space evolving vector field, whose evolution obeys the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations defined on a torus. This context is particularly relevant to the area of numerical weather forecasting and data assimilation. We will adopt a Bayesian formulation resulting from a particular regularization that ensures the problem is well posed. In the context of Monte Carlo based inference, it is a challenging task to obtain samples from the resulting high dimensional posterior on the initial condition. In real data assimilation applications it is common for computational methods to invoke the use of heuristics and Gaussian approximations. The resulting inferences are biased and not well-justified in the presence of non-linear dynamics and observations. On the other hand, Monte Carlo methods can be used to assimilate data in a principled manner, but are often perceived as inefficient in this context due to the high-dimensionality of the problem. In this work we will propose a generic Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling approach for high dimensional inverse problems that overcomes these difficulties. The method builds upon Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which are currently considered as benchmarks for evaluating data assimilation algorithms used in practice. In our numerical examples, the proposed SMC approach achieves the same accuracy as MCMC but in a much more efficient manner.},

abstract = {The computational cost of solving an inverse problem governed by PDEs, using multiple experiments, increases linearly with the number of experiments. A recently proposed method to decrease this cost uses only a small number of random linear combinations of all experiments for solving the inverse problem. This approach applies to inverse problems where the PDE solution depends linearly on the right-hand side function that models the experiment. As this method is stochastic in essence, the quality of the obtained reconstructions can vary, in particular when only a small number of combinations are used. We develop a Bayesian formulation for the definition and computation of encoding weights that lead to a parameter reconstruction with the least uncertainty. We call these weights A-optimal encoding weights. Our framework applies to inverse problems where the governing PDE is nonlinear with respect to the inversion parameter field. We formulate the problem in infinite dimensions and follow the optimize-then-discretize approach, devoting special attention to the discretization and the choice of numerical methods in order to achieve a computational cost that is independent of the parameter discretization. We elaborate our method for a Helmholtz inverse problem, and derive the adjoint-based expressions for the gradient of the objective function of the optimization problem for finding the A-optimal encoding weights. The proposed method is potentially attractive for real-time monitoring applications, where one can invest the effort to compute optimal weights offline, to later solve an inverse problem repeatedly, over time, at a fraction of the initial cost.},

abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a widely used methodology for state estimation in partial, noisily observed dynamical systems, and for parameter estimation in inverse problems. Despite its widespread use in the geophysical sciences, and its gradual adoption in many other areas of application, analysis of the method is in its infancy. Furthermore, much of the existing analysis deals with the large ensemble limit, far from the regime in which the method is typically used. The goal of this paper is to analyze the method when applied to inverse problems with fixed ensemble size. A continuous-time limit is derived and the long-time behavior of the resulting dynamical system is studied. Most of the rigorous analysis is confined to the linear forward problem, where we demonstrate that the continuous time limit of the EnKF corresponds to a set of gradient flows for the data misfit in each ensemble member, coupled through a common pre-conditioner which is the empirical covariance matrix of the ensemble. Numerical results demonstrate that the conclusions of the analysis extend beyond the linear inverse problem setting. Numerical experiments are also given which demonstrate the benefits of various extensions of the basic methodology.},

The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is the most popular approach for sampling the posterior probability distribution that describes the solution of the statistical inverse problem. MCMC methods face two central difficulties when applied to large-scale inverse problems: first, the forward models (typically in the form of partial differential equations) that map uncertain parameters to observable quantities make the evaluation of the probability density at any point in parameter space very expensive; and second, the high-dimensional parameter spaces that arise upon discretization of infinite-dimensional parameter fields make the exploration of the probability density function prohibitive.

Significant computational savings can be achieved by using this subspace to characterize and approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters. We first investigate approximation of the posterior covariance matrix as a low-rank update of the prior covariance matrix. We prove optimality of a particular update, based on the leading eigendirections of the matrix pencil defined by the Hessian of the log-likelihood and the prior precision, for a broad class of loss functions. This class includes the F{\$}\backslash{\$}"{\{}o{\}}rstner metric for symmetric positive definite matrices, as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the associated distributions. We also propose two fast approximations of the posterior mean and prove their optimality with respect to a weighted Bayes risk under squared-error loss. These approximations are particularly useful when repeated posterior mean evaluations are required for multiple data sets. We demonstrate our theoretical results with several numerical examples, including high-dimensional X-ray tomography and an inverse heat conduction problem. In both of these examples, the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the inference problem can be exploited while producing results that are essentially indistinguishable from solutions computed in the full space.},

abstract = {An inverse problem seeks to infer unknown model parameters using observed data. We consider a goal-oriented inverse problem, where the goal of inferring parameters is to use them in predicting a quantity of interest (QoI). Recognizing that multiple models of varying fidelity and computational cost may be available to describe the physical system, we formulate a goal-oriented model adaptivity approach that leverages multiple models while controlling the error in the QoI prediction. In particular, we adaptively form a mixed-fidelity model by using models of different levels of fidelity in different subregions of the domain. Taking the solution of the inverse problem with the highest-fidelity model as our reference QoI prediction, we derive an adjoint-based third-order estimate for the QoI error from using a lower-fidelity model. Localization of this error then guides the formation of mixed-fidelity models. We demonstrate the method for example problems described by convection–diffusion–reaction models. For these examples, our mixed-fidelity models use the high-fidelity model over only a small portion of the domain, but result in QoI estimates with small relative errors. We also demonstrate that the mixed-fidelity inverse problems can be cheaper to solve and less sensitive to the initial guess than the high-fidelity inverse problems.},

abstract = {Gaussian random fields over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces require the definition of appropriate covariance operators. The use of elliptic PDE operators to construct covariance operators allows to build on fast PDE solvers for manipulations with the resulting covariance and precision operators. However, PDE operators require a choice of boundary conditions, and this choice can have a strong and usually undesired influence on the Gaussian random field. We propose two techniques that allow to ameliorate these boundary effects for large-scale problems. The first approach combines the elliptic PDE operator with a Robin boundary condition, where a varying Robin coefficient is computed from an optimization problem. The second approach normalizes the pointwise variance by rescaling the covariance operator. These approaches can be used individually or can be combined. We study properties of these approaches, and discuss their computational complexity. The performance of our approaches is studied for random fields defined over simple and complex two- and three-dimensional domains.},

The estimates obtained in this case are of little value unless further information can be provided about the numerical error. In this paper we propose a novel statistical model for this numerical error set in a Bayesian framework.

abstract = {Based on the parametric deterministic formulation of Bayesian inverse problems with unknown input parameter from infinite-dimensional, separable Banach spaces proposed in Schwab and Stuart (2012 Inverse Problems 28 045003), we develop a practical computational algorithm whose convergence rates are provably higher than those of Monte Carlo (MC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, in terms of the number of solutions of the forward problem. In the formulation of Schwab and Stuart, the forward problems are parametric, deterministic elliptic partial differential equations, and the inverse problem is to determine the unknown diffusion coefficients from noisy observations comprising linear functionals of the system's response. The sparsity of the generalized polynomial chaos representation of the posterior density being implied by sparsity assumptions on the class of the prior (Schwab and Stuart 2012), we design, analyze and implement a class of adaptive, deterministic sparse tensor Smolyak quadrature schemes for the efficient approximate numerical evaluation of expectations under the posterior, given data. The proposed, deterministic quadrature algorithm is based on a greedy, iterative identification of finite sets of most significant, ‘active' chaos polynomials in the posterior density analogous to recently proposed algorithms for adaptive interpolation (Chkifa et al 2012 Report 2012-NN, 2013 Math. Modelling Numer. Anal. 47 253–80). Convergence rates for the quadrature approximation are shown, both theoretically and computationally, to depend only on the sparsity class of the unknown, but are bounded independently of the number of random variables activated by the adaptive algorithm. Numerical results for a model problem of coefficient identification with point measurements in a diffusion problem confirm the theoretical results.},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach to Inverse Problems relies predominantly on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for posterior inference. The typical nonlinear concentration of posterior measure observed in many such Inverse Problems presents severe challenges to existing simulation based inference methods. Motivated by these challenges the exploitation of local geometric information in the form of covariant gradients, metric tensors, Levi-Civita connections, and local geodesic flows, have been introduced to more effectively locally explore the configuration space of the posterior measure. However, obtaining such geometric quantities usually requires extensive computational effort and despite their effectiveness affect the applicability of these geometrically-based Monte Carlo methods. In this paper we explore one way to address this issue by the construction of an emulator of the model from which all geometric objects can be obtained in a much more computationally feasible manner. The main concept is to approximate the geometric quantities using a Gaussian Process emulator which is conditioned on a carefully chosen design set of configuration points, which also determines the quality of the emulator. To this end we propose the use of statistical experi- ment design methods to refine a potentially arbitrarily initialized design online without destroying the convergence of the resulting Markov chain to the desired invariant measure. The practical examples considered in this paper provide a demonstration of the significant improvement possible in terms of computational loading suggesting this is a promising avenue of further development.},

abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis– Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms.This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalingsmay be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain.The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automat- ically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density.The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regres- sion models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches.MATLAB code that is available from www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/ research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

abstract = {We introduce a new framework for efficient sampling from complex probability distributions, using a combination of optimal transport maps and the Metropolis-Hastings rule. The core idea is to use continuous transportation to transform typical Metropolis proposal mechanisms (e.g., random walks, Langevin methods) into non-Gaussian proposal distributions that can more effectively explore the target density. Our approach adaptively constructs a lower triangular transport map-an approximation of the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement-using information from previous MCMC states, via the solution of an optimization problem. This optimization problem is convex regardless of the form of the target distribution. It is solved efficiently using a Newton method that requires no gradient information from the target probability distribution; the target distribution is instead represented via samples. Sequential updates enable efficient and parallelizable adaptation of the map even for large numbers of samples. We show that this approach uses inexact or truncated maps to produce an adaptive MCMC algorithm that is ergodic for the exact target distribution. Numerical demonstrations on a range of parameter inference problems show order-of-magnitude speedups over standard MCMC techniques, measured by the number of effectively independent samples produced per target density evaluation and per unit of wallclock time.},

abstract = {This work proposes optimal dimensionality reduction methods adapted to the Bayesian inference of a Gaussian linear model with additive noise in presence of overabundant data. Three different optimal projections of the observations are proposed based on information theory: the projection that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior distributions of the original and the projected models, the one that minimizes the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the same distributions, and the one that maximizes the mutual information between the parameter of interest and the projected observations. The first two optimization problems are formulated as the determination of an optimal subspace and therefore the solution is computed using Riemannian optimization algorithms on the Grassmann manifold. Regarding the maximization of the mutual information, it is shown that there exists an optimal subspace that minimizes the entropy of the posterior distribution of the reduced model; a basis of the subspace can be computed as the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem; an a priori error estimate on the mutual information is available for this particular solution; and that the dimensionality of the subspace to exactly conserve the mutual information between the input and the output of the models is less than the number of parameters to be inferred. Numerical applications to linear and nonlinear models are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed approaches, and to highlight their advantages compared to standard approaches based on the principal component analysis of the observations.},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach to inverse problems, in which the posterior
probability distribution on an unknown field is sampled for the purposes
of computing posterior expectations of quantities of interest, is
starting to become computationally feasible for partial differential
equation (PDE) inverse problems. Balancing the sources of error arising
from finite-dimensional approximation of the unknown field, the PDE
forward solution map and the sampling of the probability space under
the posterior distribution are essential for the design of efficient
computational Bayesian methods for PDE inverse problems. We study
Bayesian inversion for a model elliptic PDE with an unknown diffusion
coefficient. We provide complexity analyses of several Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for the efficient numerical evaluation
of expectations under the Bayesian posterior distribution, given
data {\{}{\^{I}}{\}}´. Particular attention is given to bounds on the overall work
required to achieve a prescribed error level {\{}{\^{I}}{\}}µ. Specifically, we
first bound the computational complexity of plain MCMC, based on
combining MCMC sampling with linear complexity multi-level solvers
for elliptic PDE. Our (new) work versus accuracy bounds show that
the complexity of this approach can be quite prohibitive. Two strategies
for reducing the computational complexity are then proposed and analyzed:
first, a sparse, parametric and deterministic generalized polynomial
chaos (gpc) surrogate representation of the forward response map
of the PDE over the entire parameter space, and, second, a novel
multi-level Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy which utilizes sampling
from a multi-level discretization of the posterior and the forward
PDE. For both of these strategies, we derive asymptotic bounds on
work versus accuracy, and hence asymptotic bounds on the computational
complexity of the algorithms. In particular, we provide sufficient
conditions on the regularity of the unknown coefficients of the PDE
and on the approximation methods used, in order for the accelerations
of MCMC resulting from these strategies to lead to complexity reductions
over plain MCMC algorithms for the Bayesian inversion of PDEs.},

Usually the mathematical model of an inverse problem consists of an operator equation of the first kind and often the associated forward operator acts between Hilbert spaces. However, for numerous problems the reasons for using a Hilbert space setting seem to be based rather on conventions than on an approprimate and realistic model choice, so often a Banach space setting would be closer to reality. Furthermore, sparsity constraints using general Lp-norms or the BV-norm have recently become very popular. Meanwhile the most well-known methods have been investigated for linear and nonlinear operator equations in Banach spaces.

abstract = {The intrinsic dimensionality of an inverse problem is affected by prior information, the accuracy and number of observations, and the smoothing properties of the forward operator. From a Bayesian perspective, changes from the prior to the posterior may, in many problems, be confined to a relatively low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. We present a dimension reduction approach that defines and identifies such a subspace, called the ‘likelihood-informed subspace' (LIS), by characterizing the relative influences of the prior and the likelihood over the support of the posterior distribution. This identification enables new and more efficient computational methods for Bayesian inference with nonlinear forward models and Gaussian priors. In particular, we approximate the posterior distribution as the product of a lower-dimensional posterior defined on the LIS and the prior distribution marginalized onto the complementary subspace. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can then proceed in lower dimensions, with significant gains in computational efficiency. We also introduce a Rao−Blackwellization strategy that de-randomizes Monte Carlo estimates of posterior expectations for additional variance reduction. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods using two numerical examples: inference of permeability in a groundwater system governed by an elliptic PDE, and an atmospheric remote sensing problem based on Global Ozone Monitoring System (GOMOS) observations.},

abstract = {In this paper we establish a mathematical framework for a range of inverse problems for functions,{\$}\backslash{\$}n given a finite set of noisy observations. The problems are hence underdetermined and are often{\$}\backslash{\$}n ill-posed. We study these problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, with the resulting{\$}\backslash{\$}n posterior probability measure being defined on a space of functions. We develop an abstract{\$}\backslash{\$}n framework for such problems which facilitates application of an infinite-dimensional version of{\$}\backslash{\$}n Bayes theorem, leads to a well-posedness result for the posterior measure (continuity in a suitable{\$}\backslash{\$}n probability metric with respect to changes in data), and also leads to a theory for the existence of{\$}\backslash{\$}n maximizing the posterior probability (MAP) estimators for such Bayesian inverse problems on function{\$}\backslash{\$}n space. A central idea underlying these results is that continuity properties and bounds on the{\$}\backslash{\$}n forward model guide the choice of the prior measure for the inverse problem , leading to the desired{\$}\backslash{\$}n results on well-posedness and MAP estimators; the PDE analysis and probability theory required are{\$}\backslash{\$}n thus clearly dileneated, allowing a straightforward derivation of results. We show that the abstract{\$}\backslash{\$}n theory applies to some concrete applications of interest by studying problems arising from data{\$}\backslash{\$}n assimilation in fluid mechanics. The objective is to make inference about the underlying velocity{\$}\backslash{\$}n field, on the basis of either Eulerian or Lagrangian observations. We study problems without model{\$}\backslash{\$}n error, in which case the inference is on the initial condition, and problems with model error in{\$}\backslash{\$}n which case the inference is on the initial condition and on the driving noise process or,{\$}\backslash{\$}n equivalently, on the entire time-dependent velocity field. In order to undertake a relatively{\$}\backslash{\$}n uncluttered mathematical analysis we consider the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation on a torus.{\$}\backslash{\$}n The case of Eulerian observations—direct observations of the velocity field itself—is then a model{\$}\backslash{\$}n for weather forecasting. The case of Lagrangian observations—observations of passive tracers{\$}\backslash{\$}n advected by the flow—is then a model for data arising in oceanography. The methodology which we{\$}\backslash{\$}n describe herein may be applied to many other inverse problems in which it is of interest to find,{\$}\backslash{\$}n given observations, an infinite-dimensional object, such as the initial condition for a PDE. A{\$}\backslash{\$}n similar approach might be adopted, for example, to determine an appropriate mathematical setting for{\$}\backslash{\$}n the inverse problem of determining an unknown tensor arising in a constitutive law for a PDE, given{\$}\backslash{\$}n observations of the solution. The paper is structured so that the abstract theory can be read{\$}\backslash{\$}n independently of the particular problems in fluid mechanics which are subsequently studied by{\$}\backslash{\$}n application of the theory.},

abstract = {We investigate the stability of a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method applied to the problem of sampling from a target distribution on {\$}\backslashbackslashmathbb{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}R{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\^{}}d{\$} for large {\$}d{\$}. It is well known that using a single importance sampling step one produces an approximation for the target that deteriorates as the dimension {\$}d{\$} increases, unless the number of Monte Carlo samples {\$}N{\$} increases at an exponential rate in {\$}d{\$}. We show that this degeneracy can be avoided by introducing a sequence of artificial targets, starting from a `simple' density and moving to the one of interest, using an SMC method to sample from the sequence. Using this class of SMC methods with a fixed number of samples, one can produce an approximation for which the effective sample size (ESS) converges to a random variable {\$}\backslashbackslashvarepsilon{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}N{\$} as {\$}d\backslashbackslashrightarrow\backslashbackslashinfty{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} with {\$}1{\textless}\backslashbackslashvarepsilon{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}{\{}N{\}}{\textless}N{\$}. The convergence is achieved with a computational cost proportional to {\$}Nd{\^{}}2{\$}. If {\$}\backslashbackslashvarepsilon{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}N\backslashbackslashll N{\$}, we can raise its value by introducing a number of resampling steps, say {\$}m{\$} (where {\$}m{\$} is independent of {\$}d{\$}). In this case, ESS converges to a random variable {\$}\backslashbackslashvarepsilon{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}{\{}N,m{\}}{\$} as {\$}d\backslashbackslashrightarrow\backslashbackslashinfty{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} and {\$}\backslashbackslashlim{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}{\{}m\backslashbackslashto\backslashbackslashinfty{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}\backslashbackslashvarepsilon{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}{\{}N,m{\}}=N{\$}. Also, we show that the Monte Carlo error for estimating a fixed dimensional marginal expectation is of order {\$}\backslashbackslashfrac{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}1{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslashbackslashsqrt{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}N{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$} uniformly in {\$}d{\$}. The results imply that, in high dimensions, SMC algorithms can efficiently control the variability of the importance sampling weights and estimate fixed dimensional marginals at a cost which is less than exponential in {\$}d{\$} and indicate that, in high dimensions, resampling leads to a reduction in the Monte Carlo error and increase in the ESS.},

abstract = {Systems biology proceeds through repeated cycles of experiment and modeling. One way to implement this is reverse engineering, where models are fit to data to infer and analyse regulatory mechanisms. This requires rigorous methods to determine whether model parameters can be properly identified. Applying such methods in a complex biological context remains challenging. We use reverse engineering to study post-transcriptional regulation in pattern formation. As a case study, we analyse expression of the gap genes Kr{\"{u}}ppel, knirps, and giant in Drosophila melanogaster. We use detailed, quantitative datasets of gap gene mRNA and protein expression to solve and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation, and establish its structural and practical identifiability. Our results demonstrate that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. Our work demonstrates that the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation. This greatly increases the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other, similarly complex, biological processes.},

abstract = {IParticulate matter (PM) is a class of malicious environmental pol- lutants known to be detrimental to human health. Regulatory efforts aimed at curbing PM levels in different countries often require high resolution space-time maps that can identify red-flag regions exceed- ing statutory concentration limits. Continuous spatio-temporal Gaus- sian Process (GP) models can deliver maps depicting predicted PM levels and quantify predictive uncertainty. However, GP based ap- proaches are usually thwarted by computational challenges posed by large datasets. We construct a novel class of scalable Dynamic Near- est Neighbor Gaussian Process (DNNGP) models that can provide a sparse approximation to any spatio-temporal GP (e.g., with non- separable covariance structures). TheDNNGP we develop here can be used as a sparsity-inducing prior for spatio-temporal random effects in any Bayesian hierarchical model to deliver full posterior inference. Storage and memory requirements for a DNNGP model are linear in the size of the dataset thereby delivering massive scalability with- out sacrificing inferential richness. Extensive numerical studies reveal that the DNNGP provides substantially superior approximations to the underlying process than low rank approximations. Finally, we use the DNNGP to analyze a massive air quality dataset to substantially improve predictions of PM levels across Europe in conjunction with the LOTOS-EUROS chemistry transport models (CTMs).},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a Gaussian functional regression (GFR) technique that integrates multi-fidelity models with model reduction to efficiently predict the input-output relationship of a high-fidelity model. The GFR method combines the high-fidelity model with a low-fidelity model to provide an estimate of the output of the high-fidelity model in the form of a posterior distribution that can characterize uncertainty in the prediction. A reduced basis approximation is constructed upon the low-fidelity model and incorporated into the GFR method to yield an inexpensive posterior distribution of the output estimate. As this posterior distribution depends crucially on a set of training inputs at which the high-fidelity models are simulated, we develop a greedy sampling algorithm to select the training inputs. Our approach results in an output prediction model that inherits the fidelity of the high-fidelity model and has the computational complexity of the reduced basis approximation. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

@article{Law2014,
abstract = {Inverse problems lend themselves naturally to a Bayesian formulation, in which the quantity of interest is a posterior distribution of state and/or parameters given some uncertain observations. For the common case in which the forward operator is smoothing, then the inverse problem is ill-posed. Well-posedness is imposed via regularization in the form of a prior, which is often Gaussian. Under quite general conditions, it can be shown that the posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior and it may be well-defined on function space in terms of its density with respect to the prior. In this case, by constructing a proposal for which the prior is invariant, one can define Metropolis-Hastings schemes for MCMC which are well-defined on function space (Stuart (2010) [1], Cotter et al. [2]), and hence do not degenerate as the dimension of the underlying quantity of interest increases to infinity, e.g. under mesh refinement when approximating PDE in finite dimensions. However, in practice, despite the attractive theoretical properties of the currently available schemes, they may still suffer from long correlation times, particularly if the data is very informative about some of the unknown parameters. In fact, in this case it may be the directions of the posterior which coincide with the (already known) prior which decorrelate the slowest. The information incorporated into the posterior through the data is often contained within some finite-dimensional subspace, in an appropriate basis, perhaps even one defined by eigenfunctions of the prior. We aim to exploit this fact and improve the mixing time of function-space MCMC by careful rescaling of the proposal. To this end, we introduce two new basic methods of increasing complexity, involving (i) characteristic function truncation of high frequencies and (ii) Hessian information to interpolate between low and high frequencies. The second, more sophisticated version, bears some similarities with recent methods which exploit local curvature information, for example RMHMC, Girolami and Calderhead (2011) [3], and stochastic Newton, Martin et al. (2012) [4]. These ideas are illustrated with numerical experiments on the Bayesian inversion of the heat equation and Navier-Stokes equation, given noisy observations. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Many applications require the minimization of a smooth function ̂ f : R n u → R whose evaluation requires the solution of a system of nonlinear equations. This system represents a numerical simulation that must be run to evaluate ̂ f . This system of nonlinear equations is referred to as an implicit constraint. In principle ̂ f can be minimized using the steepest descent method or Newton-type methods for unconstrained minimization. However, for the practical application of derivative based methods for the minimization of ̂ f one has to deal with many interesting issues that arise out of the presence of the implicit constraints that must be solved to evaluate ̂ f . This article studies some of these issues, ranging from sensitivity and adjoint techniques for derivative computation to implementation issues in Newton-type methods. A discretized optimal control problem governed by the unsteady Burgers equation is used to illustrate the ideas. The material in this article is accessible to anyone with knowledge of Newton-type methods for finite dimen- sional unconstrained optimization. Many of the concepts discussed in this article extend to and are used in areas such as optimal control and PDE constrained optimization.},

abstract = {We present the fundamentals of a measure transport approach to sampling. The idea is to construct a deterministic coupling---i.e., a transport map---between a complex "target" probability measure of interest and a simpler reference measure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent and unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference samples through the map. We consider two different and complementary scenarios: first, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available, and second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite collection of samples. We show that in both settings the desired transports can be characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address practical issues associated with the optimization--based construction of transports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing monotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining approximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces. Approximate transports can also be used to "Gaussianize" complex distributions and thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We place the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections with other optimization--based samplers, with inference and density estimation schemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation--based approaches to simulation. We also sketch current work aimed at the construction of transport maps in high dimensions, exploiting essential features of the target distribution (e.g., conditional independence, low-rank structure). The approaches and algorithms presented here have direct applications to Bayesian computation and to broader problems of stochastic simulation.},

abstract = {We present an efficient method for computing A-optimal experimental designs for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we address the problem of optimizing the location of sensors (at which observational data are collected) to minimize the uncertainty in the parameters estimated by solving the inverse problem, where the uncertainty is expressed by the trace of the posterior covariance. Computing optimal experimental designs (OEDs) is particularly challenging for inverse problems governed by computationally expensive PDE models with infinite-dimensional (or, after discretization, high-dimensional) parameters. To alleviate the computational cost, we exploit the problem structure and build a low-rank approximation of the parameter-to-observable map, preconditioned with the square root of the prior covariance operator. This relieves our method from expensive PDE solves when evaluating the optimal experimental design objective function and its derivatives. Moreover, we employ a randomized trace estimator for efficient evaluation of the OED objective function. We control the sparsity of the sensor configuration by employing a sequence of penalty functions that successively approximate the {\$}\backslashbackslashell{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}0{\$}-"norm"; this results in binary designs that characterize optimal sensor locations. We present numerical results for inference of the initial condition from spatio-temporal observations in a time-dependent advection-diffusion problem in two and three space dimensions. We find that an optimal design can be computed at a cost, measured in number of forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter and sensor dimensions. We demonstrate numerically that {\$}\backslashbackslashell{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}0{\$}-sparsified experimental designs obtained via a continuation method outperform {\$}\backslashbackslashell{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}1{\$}-sparsified designs.},

We describe a new strategy for solving this problem and apply it to recently published data on early Drosophila melanogaster development. Our method is orders of magnitude faster than current fitting methods and allows us to fit different types of rules for expressing regulatory relationships. Specifically, we use our approach to fit models using a smooth nonlinear formalism for modeling gene regulation (gene circuits) as well as models using logical rules based on activation and repression thresholds for transcription factors. Our technique also allows us to infer regulatory relationships de novo or to test network structures suggested by the literature. We fit a series of models to test several outstanding questions about gap gene regulation, including regulation of and by hunchback and the role of autoactivation. Based on our modeling results and validation against the experimental literature, we propose a revised network structure for the gap gene system. Interestingly, some relationships in standard textbook models of gap gene regulation appear to be unnecessary for or even inconsistent with the details of gap gene expression during wild-type development.},

The rate depends on the amount of prior concentration near the true function and the prior mass of functions with inferior Galerkin approximation. We apply the general result to non-conjugate series priors, showing that these priors give near optimal and adaptive recovery in some generality, Gaussian priors, and mixtures of Gaussian priors, where the latter are also shown to be near optimal and adaptive. The proofs are based on general testing and approximation arguments, without explicit calculations on the posterior distribution.

We compare the performance of two classes of methods which aim to solve this issue: stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC), and divide and conquer methods. We find an SGMCMC method, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to be the most robust in these comparisons. This method makes use of a noisy estimate of the gradient of the log posterior, which significantly reduces the per iteration computational cost of the algorithm. We analyse the algorithm over different dataset sizes and show, despite the per iteration saving, the computational cost is still proportional to the dataset size. We use control variates, a method to reduce the variance in Monte Carlo estimates, to reduce this computational cost to {\$}O(1){\$}. Next we show that a different control variate technique, known as zero variance control variates can be applied to SGMCMC algorithms for free. This post-processing step improves the inference of the algorithm by reducing the variance of the MCMC output. Zero variance control variates rely on the gradient of the log posterior; we explore how the variance reduction is affected by replacing this with the noisy gradient estimate calculated by SGMCMC.},

The covariance operator for the Gaussian noise is assumed to be trace class, and the Jacobian of the forward operator Hilbert-Schmidt. We show that the appropriate space for defining the Fisher information is given by the Cameron-Martin space. This is mainly because the range space of the covariance operator always is strictly smaller than the Hilbert space. For the Fisher information to be well-defined, it is furthermore required that the range space of the Jacobian is contained in the Cameron-Martin space. In order for this condition to hold and for the Fisher information to be trace class, a sufficient condition is formulated based on the singular values of the Jacobian as well as of the eigenvalues of the covariance operator, together with some regularity assumptions regarding their relative rate of convergence. An explicit example is given regarding an electromagnetic inverse source problem with “external” spherically isotropic noise, as well as “internal” additive uncorrelated noise.},

abstract = {The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is the computational workhorse for Bayesian inverse problems. However, MCMC struggles in high-dimensional parameter spaces, since its iterates must sequentially explore the high-dimensional space. This struggle is compounded in physical applications when the nonlinear forward model is computationally expensive. One approach to accelerate MCMC is to reduce the dimension of the state space. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for subspace-based dimension reduction. An active subspace in a given inverse problem indicates a separation between a low-dimensional subspace that is informed by the data and its orthogonal complement that is constrained by the prior. With this information, one can run the sequential MCMC on the active variables while sampling independently according to the prior on the inactive variables. However, this approach to increase efficiency may introduce bias. We provide a bound on the Hellinger distance between the true posterior and its active subspace- exploiting approximation. And we demonstrate the active subspace-accelerated MCMC on two computational examples: (i) a two-dimensional parameter space with a quadratic forward model and one-dimensional active subspace and (ii) a 100-dimensional parameter space with a PDE-based forward model and a two-dimensional active subspace.},

We discuss various means of explicitly parameterizing the map and computing it efficiently through solution of an optimization problem, exploiting gradient information from the forward model when possible. The resulting algorithm overcomes many of the computational bottlenecks associated with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Advantages of a map-based representation of the posterior include analytical expressions for posterior moments and the ability to generate arbitrary numbers of independent posterior samples without additional likelihood evaluations or forward solves. The optimization approach also provides clear convergence criteria for posterior approximation and facilitates model selection through automatic evaluation of the marginal likelihood.

abstract = {The Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm provides a framework for sampling from complex, high-dimensional target distributions. In contrast with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it generates nonlocal, nonsymmetric moves in the state space, alleviating random walk type behaviour for the simulated trajectories. However, similarly to algorithms based on random walk or Langevin proposals, the number of steps required to explore the target distribution typically grows with the dimension of the state space. We define a generalized HMC algorithm which overcomes this problem for target measures arising as finite-dimensional approximations of measures {\$}\pi{\$} which have density with respect to a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The key idea is to construct an MCMC method which is well defined on the Hilbert space itself. We successively address the following issues in the infinite-dimensional setting of a Hilbert space: (i) construction of a probability measure {\$}\Pi{\$} in an enlarged phase space having the target {\$}\pi{\$} as a marginal, together with a Hamiltonian flow that preserves {\$}\Pi{\$}; (ii) development of a suitable geometric numerical integrator for the Hamiltonian flow; and (iii) derivation of an accept/reject rule to ensure preservation of {\$}\Pi{\$} when using the above numerical integrator instead of the actual Hamiltonian flow.

For Gaussian vectors and the L2-error we present detailed results for stationary and optimal quantizers. We further establish a precise link between the rate problem and Shannon-Kolmogorov's entropy of X. This allows us to compute the exact rate of convergence to zero of the minimal L2-quantization error under rather general conditions on the eigenvalues of the covariance operator. Typical rates are O((log n)-a), a {\textgreater}0. They are obtained, for instance, for the fractional Brownian motion and the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The exponent a is closely related with the L2-regularity of the process. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

The new proposal is able to incorporate information of the measure of interest. A numerical simulation of a Bayesian inverse problem indicates that a Metropolis algorithm with such a proposal performs independent of the state space dimension and the variance of the observational noise. Moreover, a qualitative convergence result is provided by a comparison argument for spectral gaps. In particular, it is shown that the generalization inherits geometric ergodicity from the Metropolis algorithm with pCN proposal.},

abstract = {A frequent matter of debate in Bayesian inversion is the question, which of the two principle point-estimators, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or the conditional mean (CM) estimate is to be preferred. As the MAP estimate corresponds to the solution given by variational regularization techniques, this is also a constant matter of debate between the two research areas. Following a theoretical argument - the Bayes cost formalism - the CM estimate is classically preferred for being the Bayes estimator for the mean squared error cost while the MAP estimate is classically discredited for being only asymptotically the Bayes estimator for the uniform cost function. In this article we present recent theoretical and computational observations that challenge this point of view, in particular for high-dimensional sparsity-promoting Bayesian inversion. Using Bregman distances, we present new, proper convex Bayes cost functions for which the MAP estimator is the Bayes estimator. We complement this finding by results that correct further common misconceptions about MAP estimates. In total, we aim to rehabilitate MAP estimates in linear inverse problems with log-concave priors as proper Bayes estimators.},

In practice, these hyperparameters are often determined via an empirical Bayesian method that maximizes the marginal likelihood function, i.e., the probability density of the data conditional on the hyperparameters. Evaluating the marginal likelihood, however, is computationally challenging for large-scale problems. In this work, we present a method to approximately evaluate marginal likelihood functions, based on a low-rank approximation of the update from the prior covariance to the posterior covariance. We show that this approximation is optimal in a minimax sense. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to implement the proposed method, based on a combination of the randomized SVD and a spectral approximation method to compute square roots of the prior covariance matrix. Several numerical examples demonstrate good performance of the proposed method.},

Quantization of a Markov pro-cess consists in a spatial discretization on finite grids optimally fitted to the dynamics of the process. Two quantization methods are proposed: the first one, called marginal quantization, relies on an optimal approximation of the marginal distributions of the process, while the second one, called Markovian quantization, looks for an optimal ap-proximation of transition probabilities of the Markov process at some points. Optimal grids and their associated weights can be computed by a stochastic gradient descent method based on Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate this optimal quantization approach with four numerical applications arising in finance: European option pricing, optimal stopping problems and American option pricing, stochastic control problems and mean-variance hedging of options and filtering in stochastic volatility models.},

Extending this concept to the infinite-dimensional setting does not always work, since non-converging infinite series may occur. So one had to identify those operators that possess something like a trace. In a first step, integral operators gener- ated from continuous kernels were treated. Then the case of operators on the infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space followed. The situation in Banach spaces turned out to be more complicated, since the missing approximation property causes a lot of trouble. To overcome those diffi- culties, we present an axiomatic approach in which operator ideals play a dominant rule. The considerations include also singular traces that, by definition, vanish on all finite rank operators.},

abstract = {Computational Bayesian inversion of operator equations with distributed uncertain input parameters is based on an infinite-dimensional version of Bayes' formula established in [31] and its nu-merical realization in [27, 28]. Based on the sparsity of the posterior density shown in [29], dimension-adaptive Smolyak quadratures afford higher convergence rates than MCMC in terms of the number M of solutions of the forward (parametric operator) equation [27, 28]. The error bounds and convergence rates obtained in [27, 28] are independent of the parameter dimension (in particular free from the curse of dimensionality) but depend on the (co)variance {\$}\Gamma{\$} {\textgreater}0 of the additive, Gaussian observation noise as exp(b{\$}\Gamma{\$} −1) for some constant b {\textgreater}0. It is proved that the Bayesian estimates admit asymptotic ex-pansions as {\$}\Gamma{\$} ↓ 0. Sufficient (nondegeneracy) conditions for the existence of finite limits as {\$}\Gamma{\$} ↓ 0 are presented. For Gaussian priors, these limits are related to MAP estimators obtained from Tikhonov regularized least-squares functionals. Non-intrusive identification of concentration points and curva-ture information of the posterior density at these points by Quasi-Newton (QN) minimization of the Bayesian potential with SR1 updates from [7, 14] is proposed. Two Bayesian estimation algorithms with robust in {\$}\Gamma{\$} performance are developed: first, dimension-adaptive Smolyak quadrature from [27, 28] combined with a novel, curvature-based reparametrization of the parametric Bayesian posterior den-sity near the (assumed unique) global maximum of the posterior density and, second, extrapolation to the limit of vanishing observation noise variance. For either approach, we prove convergence with rates independent of the number of parameters as well as of the observation noise variance {\$}\Gamma{\$}. The generalized Richardson extrapolation to the limit {\$}\Gamma{\$} ↓ 0 due to A. Sidi [30] is justified by establishing asymptotic expansions wr. to {\$}\Gamma{\$} ↓ 0 of the Bayesian estimates. Numerical experiments are presented which indicate a performance independent of {\$}\Gamma{\$} on the curvature-rescaled, adaptive Smolyak algorithm.},

These approximations are suitable for large-scale applications. In particular, we study the approx- imation of the posterior covariance of the QoI as a low-rank negative update of its prior covariance, and prove optimality of this update with respect to the natural geodesic distance on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. Assuming exact knowledge of the posterior mean of the QoI, the optimality re- sults extend to optimality in distribution with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the associated distributions. We also propose the approximation of the posterior mean of the QoI as a low-rank linear function of the data, and prove optimality of this approximation with respect to a weighted Bayes risk. Both of these optimal approximations avoid the explicit computation of the full posterior distribution of the parameters and instead focus on directions that are well informed by the data and relevant to the QoI. These directions stem from a balance among all the components of the goal–oriented inverse problem: prior information, forward model, measurement noise, and ultimate goals. We illustrate the theory using a high-dimensional inverse problem in heat transfer.},

abstract = {We present a systematic construction of FEM-based dimension- independent (discretization-invariant) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches to explore PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems in infinite dimensional parameter spaces. In particular, we consider two frameworks to achieve this goal: Metropolize-then-discretize and discretize-then-Metropolize. The former refers to the method of discretizing function-space MCMC meth- ods. The latter, on the other hand, first discretizes the Bayesian inverse prob- lem and then proposes MCMC methods for the resulting discretized poste- rior probability density. In general, these two frameworks do not commute, that is, the resulting finite dimensional MCMC algorithms are not identi- cal. The discretization step of the former may not be trivial since it in- volves both numerical analysis and probability theory, while the latter, per- haps “easier”, may not be discretization-invariant using traditional approaches. This paper constructively develops finite element (FEM) discretization schemes for both frameworks and shows that both commutativity and discretization- invariance are attained. In particular, it shows how to construct discretize- then-Metropolize approaches for both Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and the hybrid Monte Carlo method that commute with their Metropolize- then-discretize counterparts. The key that enables this achievement is a proper FEM discretization of the prior, the likelihood, and the Bayes' formula, to- gether with a correct definition of quantities such as the gradient and the covariance matrix in discretized finite dimensional parameter spaces. The im- plication is that practitioners can take advantage of the developments in this paper to straightforwardly construct discretization-invariant discretize-then- Metropolize MCMC for large-scale inverse problems. Numerical results for one- and two-dimensional elliptic inverse problems with up to 17899 parame- ters are presented to support the proposed developments. 2010},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in the Bayesian solution of inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is the computational cost of repeatedly evaluating numerical PDE models, as required by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for posterior sampling. This paper proposes a data-driven projection-based model reduction technique to reduce this computational cost. The proposed technique has two distinctive features. First, the model reduction strategy is tailored to inverse problems: the snapshots used to construct the reduced-order model are computed adaptively from the posterior distribution. Posterior exploration and model reduction are thus pursued simultaneously. Second, to avoid repeated evaluations of the full-scale numerical model as in a standard MCMC method, we couple the full-scale model and the reduced-order model together in the MCMC algorithm. This maintains accurate inference while reducing its overall computational cost. In numerical experiments considering steady-state flow in a porous medium, the data-driven reduced-order model achieves better accuracy than a reduced-order model constructed using the classical approach. It also improves posterior sampling efficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to a standard MCMC method.},

abstract = {The emergent field of probabilistic numerics has thus far lacked clear statistical principals. This paper establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods as those which can be cast as solutions to certain inverse problems within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well-defined, encompassing both non-linear and non-Gaussian models. For general computation, a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence established. The theoretical development is then extended to pipelines of computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification, with a challenging industrial application presented.},

Numerical Gaussian processes, by construction, are designed to deal with cases where: (1) all we observe are noisy data on black-box initial conditions, and (2) we are interested in quantifying the uncertainty associated with such noisy data in our solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations. Our method circumvents the need for spatial discretization of the differential operators by proper placement of Gaussian process priors. This is an attempt to construct structured and data-efficient learning machines, which are explicitly informed by the underlying physics that possibly generated the observed data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through several benchmark problems involving linear and nonlinear time-dependent operators. In all examples, we are able to recover accurate approximations of the latent solutions, and consistently propagate uncertainty, even in cases involving very long time integration.},

In particular, the method can be used to estimate expectations with respect to a target probability distribution over an infinite-dimensional and non-compact space as given, for example, by a Bayesian inverse problem with Gaussian random field prior. Under suitable assumptions the MLSMC method has the optimal {\$}O(\backslashbackslashepsilon{\{}\backslash{\^{}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}-2{\}}){\$} bound on the cost to obtain a mean-square error of {\$}O(\backslashbackslashepsilon{\{}\backslash{\^{}}{\{}{\}}{\}}2){\$}. The algorithm is accelerated by dimension-independent likelihood-informed (DILI) proposals designed for Gaussian priors, leveraging a novel variation which uses empirical sample covariance information in lieu of Hessian information, hence eliminating the requirement for gradient evaluations. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated on two examples: inversion of noisy pressure measurements in a PDE model of Darcy flow to recover the posterior distribution of the permeability field, and inversion of noisy measurements of the solution of an SDE to recover the posterior path measure.},

abstract = {Probably the most famous of Grothendieck's contributions to Banach space theory is the result that he himself described as "the fundamental theorem in the metric theory of tensor products". That is now commonly referred to as "Grothendieck's theorem" (GT in short), or sometimes as "Grothendieck's inequality". This had a major impact first in Banach space theory (roughly after 1968), then, later on, in {\$}C{\^{}}*{\$}-algebra theory, (roughly after 1978). More recently, in this millennium, a new version of GT has been successfully developed in the framework of "operator spaces" or non-commutative Banach spaces. In addition, GT independently surfaced in several quite unrelated fields:{\$}\backslash{\$} in connection with Bell's inequality in quantum mechanics, in graph theory where the Grothendieck constant of a graph has been introduced and in computer science where the Grothendieck inequality is invoked to replace certain NP hard problems by others that can be treated by "semidefinite programming" and hence solved in polynomial time. In this expository paper, we present a review of all these topics, starting from the original GT. We concentrate on the more recent developments and merely outline those of the first Banach space period since detailed accounts of that are already available, for instance the author's 1986 CBMS notes.},

This work introduces a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that can adapt to the particular structure of a posterior distribution over functions. Two distinct lines of research intersect in the methods developed here. First, we introduce a general class of operator-weighted proposal distributions that are well defined on function space, such that the performance of the resulting MCMC samplers is independent of the discretization of the function. Second, by exploiting local Hessian information and any associated low-dimensional structure in the change from prior to posterior distributions, we develop an inhomogeneous discretization scheme for the Langevin stochastic differential equation that yields operator-weighted proposals adapted to the non-Gaussian structure of the posterior. The resulting dimension-independent and likelihood-informed (DILI) MCMC samplers may be useful for a large class of high-dimensional problems where the target probability measure has a density with respect to a Gaussian reference measure. Two nonlinear inverse problems are used to demonstrate the efficiency of these DILI samplers: an elliptic PDE coefficient inverse problem and path reconstruction in a conditioned diffusion.},

abstract = {Recently there have been exciting developments in Monte Carlo methods, with the development of new MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms which are based on continuous-time, rather than discrete-time, Markov processes. This has led to some fundamentally new Monte Carlo algorithms which can be used to sample from, say, a posterior distribution. Interestingly, continuous-time algorithms seem particularly well suited to Bayesian analysis in big-data settings as they need only access a small sub-set of data points at each iteration, and yet are still guaranteed to target the true posterior distribution. Whilst continuous-time MCMC and SMC methods have been developed independently we show here that they are related by the fact that both involve simulating a piecewise deterministic Markov process. Furthermore we show that the methods developed to date are just specific cases of a potentially much wider class of continuous-time Monte Carlo algorithms. We give an informal introduction to piecewise deterministic Markov processes, covering the aspects relevant to these new Monte Carlo algorithms, with a view to making the development of new continuous-time Monte Carlo more accessible. We focus on how and why sub-sampling ideas can be used with these algorithms, and aim to give insight into how these new algorithms can be implemented, and what are some of the issues that affect their efficiency.},

Fortunately, the state space of such a chain is usually too detailed for the inferences we are interested in, in the sense that a less detailed - smaller - state space suffices to unambiguously formalise the inference. However, in general this so-called lumped state space inhibits computing exact inferences because the corresponding dynamics are unknown and/or intractable to obtain. We address this issue by considering an imprecise continuous-time Markov chain. In this way, we are able to provide guaranteed lower and upper bounds for the inferences of interest, without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.},

abstract = {Continuous-time Markov chains are mathematical models that are used to describe the state-evolution of dynamical systems under stochastic uncertainty, and have found widespread applications in various fields. In order to make these models computationally tractable, they rely on a number of assumptions that—as is well known—may not be realistic for the domain of application; in particular, the ability to provide exact numerical parameter assessments, and the applicability of time-homogeneity and the eponymous Markov property. In this work, we extend these models to imprecise continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMC's), which are a robust generalisation that relaxes these assumptions while remaining computationally tractable. More technically, an ICTMC is a set of “precise” continuous-time finite-state stochastic processes, and rather than computing expected values of functions, we seek to compute lower expectations, which are tight lower bounds on the expectations that correspond to such a set of “precise” models. Note that, in contrast to e.g. Bayesian methods, all the elements of such a set are treated on equal grounds; we do not consider a distribution over this set. Together with the conjugate notion of upper expectation, the bounds that we provide can then be intuitively interpreted as providing best- and worst-case scenarios with respect to all the models in our set of stochastic processes. The first part of this paper develops a formalism for describing continuous-time finite-state stochastic processes that does not require the aforementioned simplifying assumptions. Next, this formalism is used to characterise ICTMC's and to investigate their properties. The concept of lower expectation is then given an alternative operator-theoretic characterisation, by means of a lower transition operator, and the properties of this operator are investigated as well. Finally, we use this lower transition operator to derive tractable algorithms (with polynomial runtime complexity w.r.t. the maximum numerical error) for computing the lower expectation of functions that depend on the state at any finite number of time points.},

abstract = {We study a Markovian agent-based model (MABM) in this paper. Each agent is endowed with a local state that changes over time as the agent interacts with its neighbours. The neighbourhood structure is given by a graph. In a recent paper [Simon et al. 2011], the authors used the automorphisms of the underlying graph to generate a lumpable partition of the joint state space ensuring Markovianness of the lumped process for binary dynamics. However, many large random graphs tend to become asymmetric rendering the automorphism-based lumping approach ineffective as a tool of model reduction. In order to mitigate this problem, we propose a lumping method based on a notion of local symmetry, which compares only local neighbourhoods of vertices. Since local symmetry only ensures approximate lumpability, we quantify the approximation error by means of Kullback-Leibler divergence rate between the original Markov chain and a lifted Markov chain. We prove the approximation error decreases monotonically. The connections to fibrations of graphs are also discussed.},

This identity motivates one to use Arithmetic Mean estimator based on simulation from the prior distribution restricted to any (but reasonable) subset of the space of parameters. By trimming this space, regions of relatively low likelihood are removed, and thereby the efficiency of the Arithmetic Mean estimator is improved.

abstract = {We consider a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) whose state space is partitioned into aggregates, and each aggregate is assigned a probability measure. A sufficient condition for defining a CTMC over the aggregates is presented as a variant of weak lumpability, which also characterizes that the measure over the original process can be recovered from that of the aggregated one. We show how the applicability of de-aggregation depends on the initial distribution. The application section is devoted to illustrate how the developed theory aids in reducing CTMC models of biochemical systems particularly in connection to protein-protein interactions. We assume that the model is written by a biologist in form of site-graph-rewrite rules. Site-graph-rewrite rules compactly express that, often, only a local context of a protein (instead of a full molecular species) needs to be in a certain configuration in order to trigger a reaction event. This observation leads to suitable aggregate Markov chains with smaller state spaces, thereby providing sufficient reduction in computational complexity. This is further exemplified in two case studies: simple unbounded polymerization and early EGFR/insulin crosstalk.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address whether a (probabilistic) function of a finite homogeneous Markov chain still enjoys a Markov-type property. We propose a complete answer to this question using a linear algebra approach. At the core of our approach is the concept of invariance of a set under a matrix. In that sense, the framework of this paper is related to the so-called "geometric approach" in control theory for linear dynamical systems. This allows us to derive a collection of new results under generic assumptions on the original Markov chain. In particular, we obtain a new criterion for a function of a Markov chain to be a homogeneous Markov chain. We provide a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for checking this criterion. Moreover, a non-standard notion of observability for a linear system will be used. This allows one to show that the set of all stochastic matrices for which our criterion holds, is nowhere dense in the set of stochastic matrices. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Complex networks play an important role in human society and in nature. Stochastic multistate processes provide a powerful framework to model a variety of emerging phenomena such as the dynamics of an epidemic or the spreading of information on complex networks. In recent years, mean-field type approximations gained widespread attention as a tool to analyze and understand complex network dynamics. They reduce the model's complexity by assuming that all nodes with a similar local structure behave identically. Among these methods the approximate master equation (AME) provides the most accurate description of complex networks' dynamics by considering the whole neighborhood of a node. The size of a typical network though renders the numerical solution of multistate AME infeasible. Here, we propose an efficient approach for the numerical solution of the AME that exploits similarities between the differential equations of structurally similar groups of nodes. We cluster a large number of similar equations together and solve only a single lumped equation per cluster. Our method allows the application of the AME to real-world networks, while preserving its accuracy in computing estimates of global network properties, such as the fraction of nodes in a state at a given time.},

@article{Golightly2015,
abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of parameter inference for Markov jump process (MJP) representations of stochastic kinetic models. Since transition probabilities are intractable for most processes of interest yet forward simulation is straightforward, Bayesian inference typically proceeds through computationally intensive methods such as (particle) MCMC. Such methods ostensibly require the ability to simulate trajectories from the conditioned jump process. When observations are highly informative, use of the forward simulator is likely to be inefficient and may even preclude an exact (simulation based) analysis. We therefore propose three methods for improving the efficiency of simulating conditioned jump processes. A conditioned hazard is derived based on an approximation to the jump process, and used to generate end-point conditioned trajectories for use inside an importance sampling algorithm. We also adapt a recently proposed sequential Monte Carlo scheme to our problem. Essentially, trajectories are reweighted at a set of intermediate time points, with more weight assigned to trajectories that are consistent with the next observation. We consider two implementations of this approach, based on two continuous approximations of the MJP. We compare these constructs for a simple tractable jump process before using them to perform inference for a Lotka-Volterra system. The best performing construct is used to infer the parameters governing a simple model of motility regulation in Bacillus subtilis.},

@article{Doss2013,
abstract = {Continuous-time linear birth-death-immigration (BDI) processes are frequently used in ecology and epidemiology to model stochastic dynamics of the population of interest. In clinical settings, multiple birth-death processes can describe disease trajectories of individual patients, allowing for estimation of the effects of individual covariates on the birth and death rates of the process. Such estimation is usually accomplished by analyzing patient data collected at unevenly spaced time points, referred to as panel data in the biostatistics literature. Fitting linear BDI processes to panel data is a nontrivial optimization problem because birth and death rates can be functions of many parameters related to the covariates of interest. We propose a novel expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting linear BDI models with covariates to panel data. We derive a closed-form expression for the joint generating function of some of the BDI process statistics and use this generating function to reduce the E-step of the EM algorithm, as well as calculation of the Fisher information, to one-dimensional integration. This analytical technique yields a computationally efficient and robust optimization algorithm that we implemented in an open-source R package. We apply our method to DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, to study intrapatient time evolution of IS6110 copy number, a genetic marker frequently used during estimation of epidemiological clusters of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our analysis reveals previously undocumented differences in IS6110 birth-death rates among three major lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has important implications for epidemiologists that use IS6110 for DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.},

I explain some of the main tools: linear regularity theory, maximum principles, Kato's inequality, method of sub and supersolutions, and the Perron method. The semilinear Dirichlet problem need not have a solution for every finite measure. I give characterizations of measures for which the problem has a solution with polynomial and exponential nonlinearities in connection with capacities and Hausdorff measures.

As a prior on the diffusion coefficient, we employ a histogram-type prior with piecewise constant realisations on bins forming a partition of the time interval. Specifically, these constants are realizations of independent inverse Gamma distributed randoma variables. We justify our approach by deriving the rate at which the corresponding posterior distribution asymptotically concentrates around the data-generating diffusion coefficient. This posterior contraction rate turns out to be optimal for estimation of a H{\"{o}}lder-continuous diffusion coefficient with smoothness parameter 0 {\textless} $\lambda$ ≤ 1. Our approach is straightforward to implement, as the posterior distributions turn out to be inverse Gamma again, and leads to good practical results in a wide range of simulation examples.

abstract = {This chapter discusses the application of Malliavin's calculus to various problems in stochastic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations. The chapter examines the regularity estimates on the distribution of functionals to which Malliavin's procedure is applicable. It is shown that solutions of It{\^{o}} stochastic integral equations are smooth functions in the sense of Malliavin's calculus. The distribution of the solution to a general It{\^{o}} equation has the same regularity properties as that of a classical diffusion just so long as the coefficients of the white noise are non-degenerate. Any other method, of deducing this result and believing that it is a good example to illustrate the power of Malliavin's calculus, is not known. {\textcopyright} 1984, Elsevier Inc.

Rewriting the likelihood in terms of local time of the process, and specifying a Gaussian prior with precision operator of differential form, we show that the posterior is also Gaussian with the precision operator also of differential form. The resulting expressions are explicit and lead to algorithms which are readily implementable.

abstract = {We study the problem of estimating the coefficients of a diffusion (X-t, t greater than or equal to 0); the estimation is based on discrete data X-nDelta, n = 0, 1,..., N. The sampling frequency Delta(-1) is constant, and asymptotics are taken as the number N of observations tends to infinity. We prove that the problem of estimating both the diffusion coefficient (the volatility) and the drift in a nonparametric setting is ill-posed: the minimax rates of convergence for Sobolev constraints and squared-error loss coincide with that of a, respectively, first- and second-order linear inverse problem. To ensure ergodicity and limit technical difficulties we restrict ourselves to scalar diffusions living on a compact interval with reflecting boundary conditions.  Our approach is based on the spectral analysis of the associated Markov semigroup. A rate-optimal estimation of the coefficients is obtained via the nonparametric estimation of an eigenvalue-eigenfunction pair of the transition operator of the discrete time Markov chain (X-nDelta, n = 0, 1,..., N) in a suitable Sobolev norm, together with an estimation of its invariant density. },

@book{Bernardo1994,
abstract = {Within metrology the evaluation of measurement uncertainty plays a special and very important role. In the past the generally accepted procedure for establishing the uncertainty was the so-called error analysis . Within this procedure probability is interpreted strictly in the statistical (frequentist) sense. Since the available information needed to infer the measurand almost never consists of only observed statistical data, the inference on the basis of error analysis showed difficulties that in 1993 were overcome by an international recommendation to apply, at least within the various branches of metrology, Bayesian Statistics to measurement data. But the price to pay for the resulting consistent and satisfying evaluation procedure is to change one's view of probability and to accept the consequences. This needs guidance, particularly for those educated in frequency-based statistics. The book Bayesian Theory , first published in hardback in 1994, provides in about 600 pages a very clear, careful and well structured description of the foundations and key theoretical concepts of Bayesian Statistics. Although not written especially for metrologists and their needs to evaluate measurement data, the text to a large extent can be recommended without restriction to this community as an extensive and excellent introduction and guide to the world of Bayesian coherent reasoning. The detailed comparison with non-Bayesian theories, such as the frequentist procedures, is particularly enlightening in understanding the basic Bayesian concepts. In the volume the authors concentrate on the answer to the question of why Bayesian Statistics should be used at all. Only in future volumes will they deal with analytical and numerical techniques to implement Bayesian procedures and the study of methods of analysis for various types of models and problems. The contents of the book go well beyond the problem of statistical inference, which is viewed as a special case of decision theory. The interpretation of probability in Bayesian Statistics as well as the foundations of probability theory and decision theory are presented. Apart from modelling and model comparison the central Bayesian problem of the prior distribution, particularly in case of ignorance, is addressed at length. It is discussed in conjunction with the introduction of information-theoretic concepts. Critical issues are explicitly mentioned and discussed. Numerous examples illustrate the clearly expounded theoretical considerations. There are about 1500 references (only a few later than 1994) including a list of other Bayesian textbooks. A list of abbreviations and symbols used is unfortunately missing. Whereas the authors throughout focus on statistical concepts rather than rigorous mathematics the reader should be prepared for a mathematical presentation on the level of advanced calculus. The book will not be the primary source for an actual evaluation of the uncertainty of measurement given the model of evaluation and incomplete information about random and systematic effects occurring in measurement. But it certainly is an excellent primary source for those who wish to learn about the learning and decision process in a situation of uncertainty. It is this situation the metrologist faces after measurement when having to state what he has learned about the measurand. Wolfgang W{\"{o}}ger},

Readers are empowered to participate in the real-life data analysis situations depicted here from the beginning. The stakes are high and the reader determines the outcome. Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. In particular, all R codes are discussed with enough detail to make them readily understandable and expandable. This works in conjunction with the bayess package.},

In the first part we develop a general theory, which roughly speaking allows to deduce existence, uniqueness and stability of martingale solutions for Ld-almost every initial condition x whenever existence and uniqueness is known at the PDE level in the L∞-setting (and, conversely, if existence and uniqueness of martingale solutions is known for Ld-a.e. initial condition, then existence and uniqueness for the PDE holds). In the second part of the paper we consider situations where, on the one hand, no pointwise uniqueness result for the martingale problem is known and, on the other hand, well-posedness for the Fokker-Planck equation can be proved. Thus, the theory developed in the first part of the paper is applicable. In particular, we will study the Fokker-Planck equation in two somehow extreme situations: in the first one, assuming uniform ellipticity of the diffusion coefficients and Lipschitz regularity in time, we are able to prove existence and uniqueness in the L2-setting; in the second one we consider an additive noise and, assuming the drift b to have BV regularity and allowing the diffusion matrix a to be degenerate (also identically 0), we prove existence and uniqueness in the L∞-setting. Therefore, in these two situations, our theory yields existence, uniqueness and stability results for martingale solutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two-sided Gaussian estimates for the fundamental solution of a second order linear parabolic differential equation are upper and lower bounds in terms of the fundamental solution of the classical heat conduction equation. In his seminal 1958 paper Nash stated, without proof, two-sided non-Gaussian bounds for the fundamental solution of a uniformly parabolic divergence structure equation assuming only boundedness of the coefficients. In his 1967-1968 papers Aronson derived truly Gaussian estimates for the fundamental solutions of a large class of linear parabolic equations (including the divergence structure equation) under minimal non-regularity assumptions on the coefficients. Subsequently in 1986 Fabes {\&} Stroock derived Gaussian estimates for the divergence structure equation directly from the ideas of Nash and went on to prove Nash's continuity theorem and the Harnack inequality as a consequence of their estimate. In this note I describe these results together with various extensions.},

abstract = {Recently, a computationally-efficient method was presented for calibrating a wide-class of Markov processes from discrete-sampled abundance data. The method was illustrated with respect to one-dimensional processes and required the assumption of stationarity. Here we demonstrate that the approach may be directly extended to multi-dimensional processes, and two analogous computationally-efficient methods for non-stationary processes are developed. These methods are illustrated with respect to disease and population models, including application to infectious count data from an outbreak of "Russian influenza" (A/USSR/1977 H1N1) in an educational institution. The methodology is also shown to provide an efficient, simple and yet rigorous approach to calibrating disease processes with gamma-distributed infectious period. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Bibliographical and historical comments and an extensive bibliography with 2000 works covering more than a century are provided. Volume 1 is devoted to the classical theory of measure and integral. Whereas the first volume presents the ideas that go back mainly to Lebesgue, the second volume is to a large extent the result of the later development up to the recent years. The central subjects of Volume 2 are: transformations of measures, conditional measures, and weak convergence of measures. These topics are closely interwoven and form the heart of modern measure theory. The target readership includes graduate students interested in deeper knowledge of measure theory, instructors of courses in measure and integration theory, and researchers in all fields of mathematics. The book may serve as a source for many advanced courses or as a reference.},

The drift is modeled by a scaled linear combination of basis functions with a Gaussian prior on the coefficients. The scaling parameter is equipped with a partially conjugate prior. The number of basis functions in the drift is equipped with a prior distribution as well. For continuous data, a reversible jump Markov chain algorithm enables the exploration of the posterior over models of varying dimension. Subsequently, it is explained how data-augmentation can be used to extend the algorithm to deal with diffusions observed discretely in time. Some examples illustrate that the method can give satisfactory results. In these examples a comparison is made with another existing method as well. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This book gives a coherent account of the statistical theory in infinite-dimensional parameter spaces. The mathematical foundations include self-contained 'mini-courses' on the theory of Gaussian and empirical processes, on approximation and wavelet theory, and on the basic theory of function spaces. The theory of statistical inference in such models - hypothesis testing, estimation and confidence sets - is then presented within the minimax paradigm of decision theory. This includes the basic theory of convolution kernel and projection estimation, but also Bayesian nonparametrics and nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation. In the final chapter, the theory of adaptive inference in nonparametric models is developed, including Lepski's method, wavelet thresholding, and adaptive inference for self-similar functions."--Publisher's description. 1.

abstract = {Estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. From a Bayesian computational perspective it can be casted as a missing data problem where the diffusion bridges in between discrete-time observations are missing. The computational problem can then be dealt with using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method known as data-augmentation. If unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, direct implementation of data-augmentation results in a Markov chain that is reducible. Furthermore, data-augmentation requires efficient sampling of diffusion bridges, which can be difficult, especially in the multidimensional case. We present a general framework to deal with with these problems that does not rely on discretisation. The construction generalises previous approaches and sheds light on the assumptions necessary to make these approaches work. We define a random-walk type Metropolis-Hastings sampler for updating diffusion bridges. Our methods are illustrated using guided proposals for sampling diffusion bridges. These are Markov processes obtained by adding a guiding term to the drift of the diffusion. We give general guidelines on the construction of these proposals and introduce a time change and scaling of the guided proposal that reduces discretisation error. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our methods.},

We analyse the nonlinear inverse problem corresponding to the "low frequency sampling" regime where {\textgreater} 0 is fixed and n → ∞. A general theorem is proved that gives conditions for prior distributions on the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ and the drift function b that ensure minimax optimal contraction rates of the posterior distribution over H{\"{o}}lder-Sobolev smoothness classes. These conditions are verified for natural examples of nonparametric random wavelet series priors. For the proofs, we derive new concentration inequalities for empirical processes arising from discretely observed diffusions that are of independent interest.},

Such equations arise, for example, in uncertainty quantification in sub- surface flow modeling. Models for random coefficients frequently used in these applications, such as log-normal random fields with exponential covariance, have only very limited spatial regularity and lead to variational problems that lack uniform coercivity and boundedness with respect to the random parameter. In our analysis we overcome these challenges by a careful treatment of the model problem almost surely in the random parameter, which then enables us to prove uniform bounds on the finite element error in standard Bochner spaces. These new bounds can then be used to perform a rigorous analysis of the multilevel Monte Carlo method for these elliptic problems that lack full regularity and uniform coercivity and boundedness. To conclude, we give some numerical results that confirm the new bounds.},

abstract = {The aim of the paper has been to provide objective data comparable to world literature, on the status of masticatory organ in the population of adults aged 35-44 years in Poland. As many as 1380 subjects were studied in 9 voivodeships with due consideration to three inhabited environments: big town, small town and village. The studies were performed in artificial lighting, using a probe and dental mirror, on the basis of methodology found in the WHO instruction of 1986 (Fig. 1.). The status of periodontium and the therapeutic requirements in that respect were assessed by resorting to CPITN index and WHO 621 periodontologic probe. The data concerning the status of dentition reveal a high frequency of caries, claiming 99.8{\%}, as well as high intensity of caries expressed by mean number of DMF equal to 18.6. Despite the fact that the provided index values are comparable to values reached by the majority of developed countries, in case of Polish population aged 35-44 years there is, unlike those countries, very unfavourable distribution for components of D, M and F. The highest value (10.5) is requested by the mean number of missing teeth (M), by mean number of carious teeth (D) with 4.1, while, unfortunately, the lowest being the mean number of filled teeth (F), which is hardly 4.0. So high means of numbers for missing teeth and carious ones indicate that despite the low percentage of toothless subjects in the studied population (1.0{\%}), it will be impossible to reach the 4th health target launched by WHO in the year 2000, it means a 50{\%} reduction in the number of toothless subjects aged 35-44 years. It is evident from data concerning the status of dentition that in the oral cavity of each subject studied there were on the average 21 teeth whereof only 37.2{\%} were made up of healthy teeth. The presence of healthy teeth was recorded more frequently in mandible than in maxilla and most frequently these were incisors and lower canines. Missing teeth (regardless of cause) were disclosed more frequently in maxilla than in mandible. The analysis of the missing teeth according to individual group of teeth reveals their very unfavourable distribution primarily in the lateral segments, it means in zone of support of the masticatory organ. That results in its far reaching consequences with regard to parodontial diseases and temporo-mandibular joints. The established results of studies covering parodontium disclose that it is unrealistic to achieve the 2nd periodontological target of health fixed by WHO for the year 2000, assuming that 75.0{\%} of population aged 35-44 years should possess at least 3 healthy sextants, while deep periodontal pockets (6 mm) were detected in 15.0{\%} of the examined subjects. The poor status of parodontal health is accompanied by colossal need of treatment in this respect. Almost 100{\%} of subjects required instructions with regard to brushing as well as professional procedure in removing dental deposits, whereas 15.0{\%} of the studied demanded specialistic periodontal treatment. The health status of parodontium and the therapeutic demands in this respect for Polish population are also unfavourable against the background of the population residing in the developed countries. The considerable dental losses revealed in the investigation exerted an influence on the prosthetic state of requirements closely related to the above finding. The analysis of data points to high percentages of persons not using removable dentures, particularly the lower ones. It was simultaneously noted that women were more frequent users of movable dentures both upper and lower. No therapeutic requirements involving the upper removable denture were evidenced in a higher percentage of the studied subjects than in the case of lower movable dentures. More persons asked for partial upper denture than lower. As concerns complete denture the situation is found to be reversed. It appears from the data concerning the temporo-mandible joints that in 70.6{\%} of},

abstract = {Performing fully Bayesian inference for the reaction rate constants governing stochastic ki-netic models (SKMs) is a challenging problem. Consequently, the Markov jump process repre-sentation is routinely replaced by an approximation based on a suitable time discretisation of the system of interest. For example, assuming that instantaneous rates of reactions are constant over a small time period leads to a Poisson approximation of the number of reaction events in the interval. Further approximating the number of reaction events as Gaussian leads to the chemical Langevin equation (also known as the diffusion approximation). Improving the accuracy of these schemes amounts to using an ever finer discretisation level, which in the context of the inference problem, requires integrating over the uncertainty in the process at a predetermined number of intermediate times between observations. Pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings schemes are increasingly used, since for a given discretisation level, the observed data likelihood can be un-biasedly estimated using a particle filter. When observations are particularly informative an auxiliary particle filter can be implemented, by employing an appropriate construct to push the state particles towards the observations in a sensible way. Recent work in state-space settings has shown how the pseudo-marginal approach can be made much more efficient by correlating the underlying pseudo random numbers used to form the likelihood estimate at the current and proposed values of the unknown parameters. We extend this approach to the time discretised SKM framework by correlating the innovations that drive the auxiliary particle filter. We find that the resulting approach offers substantial gains in efficiency over a standard implementation.},

abstract = {Advances in sampling schemes for Markov jump processes have recently enabled multiple inferential tasks. However, in statistical and machine learning applications, we often require that these continuous-time models find support on structured and infinite state spaces. In these cases, exact sampling may only be achieved by often inefficient particle filtering procedures, and rapidly augmenting observed datasets remains a significant challenge. Here, we build on the principles of uniformization and present a tractable framework to address this problem, which greatly improves the efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods commonly used in small finite-state systems, and further scales their use to infinite-state scenarios. We capitalize on the marginal role of variable subsets in a model hierarchy during the process jumps, and describe an algorithm that relies on measurable mappings between pairs of states and carefully designed sets of synthetic jump observations. The proposed method enables the efficient integration of slice sampling techniques and it can overcome the existing computational bottleneck. We offer evidence by means of experiments addressing inference and clustering tasks on both simulated and real data sets.},

abstract = {Diffusion processes governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a well-established tool for modelling continuous time data from a wide range of areas. Consequently, techniques have been developed to estimate diffusion parameters from partial and discrete observations. Likelihood-based inference can be problematic as closed form transition densities are rarely available. One widely used solution involves the introduction of latent data points between every pair of observations to allow a Euler-Maruyama approximation of the true transition densities to become accurate. In recent literature, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been used to sample the posterior distribution of latent data and model parameters; however, naive schemes suffer from a mixing problem that worsens with the degree of augmentation. A global MCMC scheme that can be applied to a large class of diffusions and whose performance is not adversely affected by the number of latent values is therefore explored. The methodology is illustrated by estimating parameters governing an auto-regulatory gene network, using partial and discrete data that are subject to measurement error. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Epidemiological parameters for livestock diseases are often inferred from transmission experiments. However, there are several limitations inherent to the design of such experiments that limits the precision of parameter estimates. In particular, infection times and latent periods cannot be directly observed and infectious periods may also be censored. We present a Bayesian framework accounting for these features directly and employ Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to provide robust inferences and quantify the uncertainty in our estimates. We describe the transmission dynamics using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed compartmental model, with gamma-distributed transition times. We then fit the model to published data from transmission experiments for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV). Where the previous analyses of these data made various assumptions on the unobserved processes in order to draw inferences, our Bayesian approach includes the unobserved infection times and latent periods and quantifies them along with all other model parameters. Drawing inferences about infection times helps identify who infected whom and can also provide insights into transmission mechanisms. Furthermore, we are able to use our models to measure the difference between the latent periods of inoculated and contact-challenged animals and to quantify the effect vaccination has on transmission.},

abstract = {Retinula cells in the compound eye of the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) were recorded intracellularly and stained with Lucifer yellow. Two different methods were used to determine the spectral sensitivity of these cells: a) the spectral scanning method, and b) the conventional flash method. Three spectral types, with S($\lambda$)-curves close to the rhodopsin-absorption functions, were found with max at 332 nm (UV), 445 nm (blue) and 515 nm (green), respectively. Blue receptors were only recorded in the anatomically specialized dorsal rim area (DRA), and UV and green receptors in the dorsal region of the pigmented part of the eye, whereby green receptors were only found in the ventral eye. On the basis of these results, model calculations are presented for di- and trichromatic colour vision in the cricket. The fluorescence markings revealed green receptors whose axons project with short visual fibres to the lamina, and a UV receptor with a long visual fibre which projects through the lamina to the medulla. The blue receptors send their axons either to the lamina and medulla (long visual fibres) or only to the lamina (short visual fibres). The temporal dynamics of the three receptor types were examined. The blue receptors lack a phasic component of the receptor potential, and the time from stimulus on-set to peak potential is strongly increased compared to the UV and green receptors. Light adaptation reduces the latency to less than half of the dark adapted state. Spectral adaptation experiments revealed an unidirectional coupling between UV and green receptors, and it was found that polarization sensitivity (PS) in blue cells was much higher (PS= 6.5±1.5) than that of UV (PS=1.76±0.05) and green (2.26±0.57) receptors. The functional aspects of the three receptor types are discussed with respect to the presented physiological and morphological data.

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

abstract = {Contact patterns in populations fundamentally influence the spread of infectious diseases. Current mathematical methods for epidemiological forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact patterns may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or sexual relationships. Here, we develop a mathematical approach to predicting disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a characteristic behaviour (typical contact number), but the identities of their contacts change in time. We show that dynamic contact patterns shape epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter, thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models. Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high school, we demonstrate the application of this method for forecasting and controlling sexually transmitted disease outbreaks.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Approaches to Bayesian inference for problems with intractable likelihoods have become increasingly important in recent years. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and “likelihood free” Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are popular methods for tackling inference in these scenarios but such techniques are computationally expensive. In this paper we compare the two approaches to inference, with a particular focus on parameter inference for stochastic kinetic models, widely used in systems biology. Discrete time transition kernels for models of this type are intractable for all but the most trivial systems yet forward simulation is usually straightforward. We discuss the relative merits and drawbacks of each approach whilst considering the computational cost implications and efficiency of these techniques. In order to explore the properties of each approach we examine a range of observation regimes using two example models. We use a Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model to explore the impact of full or partial species observations using various time course observations under the assumption of known and unknown measurement error. Further investigation into the impact of observation error is then made using a Schl{\"{o}}gl system, a test case which exhibits bi-modal state stability in some regions of parameter space.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Recently-proposed particle MCMC methods provide a flexible way of performing Bayesian inference for parameters governing stochastic kinetic models defined as Markov (jump) processes (MJPs). Each iteration of the scheme requires an estimate of the marginal likelihood calculated from the output of a sequential Monte Carlo scheme (also known as a particle filter). Consequently, the method can be extremely computationally intensive. We therefore aim to avoid most instances of the expensive likelihood calculation through use of a fast approximation. We consider two approximations: the chemical Langevin equation diffusion approximation (CLE) and the linear noise approximation (LNA). Either an estimate of the marginal likelihood under the CLE, or the tractable marginal likelihood under the LNA can be used to calculate a first step acceptance probability. Only if a proposal is accepted under the approximation do we then run a sequential Monte Carlo scheme to compute an estimate of the marginal likelihood under the true MJP and construct a second stage acceptance probability that permits exact (simulation based) inference for the MJP. We therefore avoid expensive calculations for proposals that are likely to be rejected. We illustrate the method by considering inference for parameters governing a Lotka-Volterra system, a model of gene expression and a simple epidemic process.},

abstract = {With a view to statistical inference for discretely observed diffusion models, we propose simple methods of simulating diffusion bridges, approximately and exactly. Diffusion bridge simula-tion plays a fundamental role in likelihood and Bayesian inference for diffusion processes. First a simple method of simulating approximate diffusion bridges is proposed and studied. Then these approximate bridges are used as proposal for an easily implemented Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that produces exact diffusion bridges. The new method utilizes time-reversibility prop-erties of one-dimensional diffusions and is applicable to all one-dimensional diffusion processes with finite speed-measure. One advantage of the new approach is that simple simulation methods like the Milstein scheme can be applied to bridge simulation. Another advantage over previous bridge simulation methods is that the proposed method works well for diffusion bridges in long intervals because the computational complexity of the method is linear in the length of the interval. For $\rho$-mixing diffusions the approximate method is shown to be particularly accurate for long time intervals. In a simulation study, we investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the approximate method and compare it to exact simulation methods. In the study, our method provides a very good approximation to the distribution of a diffusion bridge for bridges that are likely to occur in applications to statistical inference. To illustrate the usefulness of the new method, we present an EM-algorithm for a discretely observed diffusion process.},

The birth and death rates of M(t) depend on the rates of N(t) and on the probability law of the process N(t) evaluated at an exponentially distributed random time. Under a suitable assumption we obtain the conditional probabilities, the mean of the process, and the Laplace transforms of the downward first-passage-time densities of M(t). We also discuss the connection between the proposed method and the notion of $\nu$-similarity, as well as a relation between the distribution of M(t) and the steady-state probabilities of N(t) subject to catastrophes governed by a Poisson process. We investigate new processes constructed from (i) a birth-death process with constant rates, and (ii) a linear immigration-death process. Various numerical computations are performed to illustrate the obtained results.},

@article{McKinley2014,
abstract = {A powerful and flexible method for fitting dynamic models to missing and censored data is to use the Bayesian paradigm via data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC). This samples from the joint posterior for the parameters and missing data, but requires high memory overheads for large-scale systems. In addition, designing efficient proposal distributions for the missing data is typically challenging. Pseudo-marginal methods instead integrate across the missing data using a Monte Carlo estimate for the likelihood, generated from multiple independent simulations from the model. These techniques can avoid the high memory requirements of DA-MCMC, and under certain conditions produce the exact marginal posterior distribution for parameters. A novel method is presented for implementing importance sampling for dynamic epidemic models, by conditioning the simulations on sets of validity criteria (based on the model structure) as well as the observed data. The flexibility of these techniques is illustrated using both removal time and final size data from an outbreak of smallpox. It is shown that these approaches can circumvent the need for reversible-jump MCMC, and can allow inference in situations where DA-MCMC is impossible due to computationally infeasible likelihoods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Infectious diseases both within human and animal populations often pose serious health and socioeconomic risks. From a statistical perspective, their prediction is complicated by the fact that no two epidemics are identical due to changing contact habits, mutations of infectious agents, and changing human and animal behaviour in response to the presence of an epidemic. Thus model param- eters governing infectious mechanisms will typically be unknown. On the other hand, epidemic control strategies need to be decided rapidly as data accumulate. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian methodology for performing inference and online prediction for epidemics in structured populations. Key features of our approach are the development of an MCMC- (and adaptive MCMC-) based methodology for parameter estimation, epidemic prediction, and online assessment of risk from currently unobserved infections. We illustrate our methods using two complementary studies: an analysis of the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth epidemic, and modelling the potential risk from a possible future Avian Influenza epidemic to the UK Poultry industry.},

abstract = {The paper extends the susceptible-exposed-infective-removed model to handle heterogeneity introduced by spatially arranged populations, biologically plausible distributional assumptions and incorporation of observations from additional diagnostic tests. These extensions are motivated by a desire to analyse disease transmission experiments in a more detailed fashion than before. Such experiments are performed by veterinarians to gain knowledge about the dynamics of an infectious disease. By fitting our spatial susceptible-exposed-infective-removed with diagnostic testing model to data for a specific disease and production environment a valuable decision support tool is obtained, e.g. when evaluating on-farm control measures. Partial observability of the epidemic process is an inherent problem when trying to estimate model parameters from experimental data. We therefore extend existing work on Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation in partially observable epidemics to the multitype epidemic set-up of our model. Throughout the paper, data from a Belgian classical swine fever virus transmission experiment are used as a motivating example.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors. For many stochastic models, it is difficult to make inference about the model parameters because it is impossible to write down a tractable likelihood given the observed data. A common solution is data augmentation in a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. However, there are statistical problems where this approach has proved infeasible but where simulation from the model is straightforward leading to the popularity of the approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. We introduce a forward simulation MCMC (fsMCMC) algorithm, which is primarily based upon simulation from the model. The fsMCMC algorithm formulates the simulation of the process explicitly as a data augmentation problem. By exploiting non-centred parameterizations, an efficient MCMC updating schema for the parameters and augmented data is introduced, whilst maintaining straightforward simulation from the model. The fsMCMC algorithm is successfully applied to two distinct epidemic models including a birth-death-mutation model that has only previously been analysed using approximate Bayesian computation methods.},

In the current paper, we study different types of egocentric data, and show which global network properties are consistent with data. Two global network properties are considered: the size of the largest connected component (the giant) and the size of an epidemic outbreak taking place on the network. The main conclusion is that, in most cases, egocentric data allow for a large range of possible sizes of the giant and the outbreak, implying that egocentric data carry very little information about these global properties. The asymptotic size of the giant and the outbreak is also characterized, assuming the network is selected uniformly among networks with prescribed egocentric data.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with a general stochastic model for SIR epidemics, among a closed finite population, in which during its infectious period a typical infective makes both local and global contacts. Each local contact of a given infective is with an individual chosen independently according to a contact distribution 'centred' on that infective, and each global contact is with an individual chosen independently and uniformly from the whole population. The asymptotic situation in which the local contact distribution remains fixed as the population becomes large is considered. The concepts of local infectious clump and local susceptibility set are used to develop a unified approach to the threshold behaviour of this class of epidemic models. In particular, a threshold parameter R* governing whether or not global epidemics can occur, the probability that a global epidemic occurs and the mean proportion of initial susceptibles ultimately infected by a global epidemic are all determined. The theory is specialised to (i) the households model, in which the population is partitioned into households and local contacts are chosen uniformly within an infective's household; (ii) the overlapping groups model, in which the population is partitioned in several ways, with local uniform mixing within the elements of the partitions; and (iii) the great circle model, in which individuals are equally spaced on a circle and local contacts are nearest-neighbour.},

abstract = {This paper considers metapopulation models in the general sense, i.e. where the population is partitioned into sub-populations (groups, patches,...), irrespective of the biological interpretation they have, e.g. spatially segregated large sub-populations, small households or hosts themselves modelled as populations of pathogens. This framework has traditionally provided an attractive approach to incorporating more realistic contact structure into epidemic models, since it often preserves analytic tractability (in stochastic as well as deterministic models) but also captures the most salient structural inhomogeneity in contact patterns in many applied contexts. Despite the progress that has been made in both the theory and application of such metapopulation models, we present here several major challenges that remain for future work, focusing on models that, in contrast to agent-based ones, are amenable to mathematical analysis. The challenges range from clarifying the usefulness of systems of weakly-coupled large sub-populations in modelling the spread of specific diseases to developing a theory for endemic models with household structure. They include also developing inferential methods for data on the emerging phase of epidemics, extending metapopulation models to more complex forms of human social structure, developing metapopulation models to reflect spatial population structure, developing computationally efficient methods for calculating key epidemiological model quantities, and integrating within- and between-host dynamics in models.},

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.},

The network is given by a random graph following a multilayer configuration model where edges in different layers correspond to potentially infectious contacts of different types. We assume that the graph structure evolves in response to the epidemic via activation or deactivation of edges. We derive a large graph limit theorem that gives a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the evolution of quantities of interest, such as the proportions of infected and susceptible vertices, as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Analysis of the limiting system elucidates how the coupling of edge activation and deactivation to infection status affects disease dynamics, as illustrated by a two-layer network example with edge types corresponding to community and healthcare contacts. Our theorem extends some earlier results deriving the deterministic limit of stochastic SIR processes on static, single-layer configuration model graphs. We also describe precisely the conditions for equivalence between our limiting ODEs and the systems obtained via pair approximation, which are widely used in the epidemiological and ecological literature to approximate disease dynamics on networks. Potential applications include modeling Ebola dynamics in West Africa, which was the motivation for this study.},

abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.},

abstract = {Information, disease, and influence diffuse over networks of entities in both natural systems and human society. Analyzing these transmission networks plays an important role in understanding the diffusion processes and predicting future events. However, the underlying transmission networks are often hidden and incomplete, and we observe only the time stamps when cascades of events happen. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of uncovering the hidden network only from the cascades. The structure discovery problem is complicated by the fact that the influence between networked entities is heterogeneous, which can not be described by a simple parametric model. Therefore, we propose a kernel- based method which can capture a diverse range of different types of influence without any prior assumption. In both synthetic and real cascade data, we show that our model can better recover the underlying diffusion network and drastically improve the estimation of the transmission functions among networked entities.},

abstract = {In many real-world scenarios, it is nearly impossible to collect explicit social network data. In such cases, whole networks must be inferred from underlying observations. Here, we formulate the problem of inferring latent social networks based on network diffusion or disease propagation data. We consider contagions propagating over the edges of an unobserved social network, where we only observe the times when nodes became infected, but not who infected them. Given such node infection times, we then identify the optimal network that best explains the observed data. We present a maximum likelihood approach based on convex programming with a l1-like penalty term that encourages sparsity. Experiments on real and synthetic data reveal that our method near-perfectly recovers the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the contagion propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well as it can infer optimal networks of thousands of nodes in a matter of minutes.},

abstract = {Time plays an essential role in the diffusion of information, influence, and disease over networks. In many cases we can only observe when a node is activated by a contagion— when a node learns about a piece of information, makes a decision, adopts a new behavior, or becomes infected with a disease. However, the underlying network connectivity and transmission rates between nodes are unknown. Inferring the underlying diffusion dynamics is important because it leads to new insights and enables forecasting, as well as influencing or containing information propagation. In this paper we model diffusion as a continuous temporal process occurring at different rates over a latent, unobserved network that may change over time. Given information diffusion data, we infer the edges and dynamics of the underlying network. Our model naturally imposes sparse solutions and requires no parameter tuning. We develop an efficient inference algorithm that uses stochastic convex optimization to compute online estimates of the edges and transmission rates. We evaluate our method by tracking information diffusion among 3.3 million mainstream media sites and blogs, and experiment with more than 179 million different instances of information spreading over the network in a one-year period. We apply our network inference algorithm to the top 5,000 media sites and blogs and report several interesting observations. First, information pathways for general recurrent topics are more stable across time than for on- going news events. Second, clusters of news media sites and blogs often emerge and vanish in a matter of days for on-going news events. Finally, major events, for example, large scale civil unrest as in the Libyan civil war or Syrian uprising, increase the number of information pathways among blogs, and also increase the network centrality of blogs and social media sites.},

@article{Volz2008,
abstract = {Random networks with specified degree distributions have been proposed as realistic models of population structure, yet the problem of dynamically modeling SIR-type epidemics in random networks remains complex. I resolve this dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three nonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function (PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson. The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper introduces an approach known as a “pair approximation” developed in physics and mathematical biology that captures some of the effects of network structure in a compartmental system dynamics (CSD) model without substantially increasing model complexity or computational efficiency. We describe the approach using a familiar example: the standard SIS model from epidemiology that underpins many models from the marketing and innovation diffusion literature. We show that the pair approximation better approximates the results of an agent‐based simulation than the standard CSD. The model provides insights regarding the epidemic threshold, with implications for halting the spread of a disease or encouraging the spread of a product, that cannot be obtained from the standard CSD. We further illustrate the technique through the development of two new CSD models: a model of social contagion, SIS2, that allows for “social recovery,” and a model of technology adoption with local network effects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

abstract = {We study the propagation of susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) disease on random networks with spatial structure. We consider random spatial networks (RSNs) with heterogeneous degrees, where any two nodes are connected by an edge with a probability that depends on their spatial distance and expected degrees. This is a natural spatial extension of the well-known Erdős–R{\'{e}}nyi and Chung–Lu random graphs. In the limit of high node density, we derive partial integro-differential equations governing the spread of SIR disease through an RSN. We demonstrate that these nonlocal evolution equations quantitatively predict stochastic simulations. We analytically show the existence of travelling wave solutions on the RSNs. If the distance kernel governing edge placement in the RSNs decays slower than exponential, the population-scale dynamics are dominated by long-range hops followed by local spread of travelling waves. This provides a theoretical modelling framework for disease propagation on networks with spatial structure, extending analytic SIR modelling capabilities from networks without spatial structure to the important real-life case of networks with spatial structure. Potential applications of this modelling framework include studying the interplay between long-range and short-range transmissions in designing polio vaccination strategies, wavelike spread of the plague in medieval Europe, and recent observations of how epidemics like Ebola evolve in modern connected societies.},

The numbers of infected individuals during the initial stages of an epidemic can be well approximated by a branching process, after which the proportion of individuals that are susceptible follows a more or less deterministic course. In this paper, we show that both of these features are consequences of assuming a locally branching structure in the models, and that the deterministic course can itself be determined from the distribution of the limiting random variable associated with the backward, susceptibility branching process. Examples considered includea stochastic version of the Kermack {\&} McKendrick model, the Reed-Frost model, and the Volz configuration model.},

Whether an organism can successfully invade and persist in the short-term is highly dependent on the spatial correlations that develop in the early stages of invasion. By modelling the correlations between individuals, we are able to understand the role of spatial heterogeneity in invasion dynamics without the need for large-scale computer simulations. Here, a natural methodology is developed for modelling the behaviour of individuals in a fixed network. This formulation is applied to the spread of a disease through a structured network to determine invasion thresholds and some statistical properties of a single epidemic.},

Historically, many epidemics spread as a wave across part of the Earth's surface; however, in modern contagions long-range edges -- for example, due to airline transportation or communication media -- allow clusters of a contagion to appear in distant locations. Here we study the spread of contagions on networks through a methodology grounded in topological data analysis and nonlinear dimension reduction. We construct "contagion maps" that use multiple contagions on a network to map the nodes as a point cloud. By analyzing the topology, geometry, and dimensionality of manifold structure in such point clouds, we reveal insights to aid in the modeling, forecast, and control of spreading processes. Our approach highlights contagion maps also as a viable tool for inferring low-dimensional structure in networks.},

abstract = {Chemical reaction networks which exhibit strong fluctuations are common in microscopic systems in which reactants appear in low copy numbers. The analysis of these networks requires stochastic methods, which come in two forms: direct integration of the master equation and Monte Carlo simulations. The master equation becomes infeasible for large networks because the number of equations increases exponentially with the number of reactive species. Monte Carlo methods, which are more efficient in integrating over the exponentially large phase space, also become impractical due to the large amounts of noisy data that need to be stored and analyzed. The recently introduced multiplane method [ A. Lipshtat and O. Biham Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 170601 (2004)] is an efficient framework for the stochastic analysis of large reaction networks. It is a dimensional reduction method, based on the master equation, which provides a dramatic reduction in the number of equations without compromising the accuracy of the results. The reduction is achieved by breaking the network into a set of maximal fully connected subnetworks (maximal cliques). A separate master equation is written for the reduced probability distribution associated with each clique, with suitable coupling terms between them. This method is highly efficient in the case of sparse networks, in which the maximal cliques tend to be small. However, in dense networks some of the cliques may be rather large and the dimensional reduction is not as effective. Furthermore, the derivation of the multiplane equations from the master equation is tedious and difficult. Here we present the reduced-multiplane method in which the maximal cliques are broken down to the fundamental two-vertex cliques. The number of equations is further reduced, making the method highly efficient even for dense networks. Moreover, the equations take a simpler form, which can be easily constructed using a diagrammatic procedure, for any desired network architecture. It is shown that the method provides accurate results for the population sizes of the reactive species and their reaction rates.},

This paradigm, rooted in Boltzmann's gas theory, has found applications from magnetic phenomena to subcellular processes and epidemic spreading. Yet, each of these advances were the result of decades of meticulous model building and validation, which are impossible to replicate in most complex biological, social or technological systems that lack accurate microscopic models. Here we develop a method to infer the microscopic dynamics of a complex system from observations of its response to external perturbations, allowing us to construct the most general class of nonlinear pairwise dynamics that are guaranteed to recover the observed behaviour. The result, which we test against both numerical and empirical data, is an effective dynamic model that can predict the system's behaviour and provide crucial insights into its inner workings.},

Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system's response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system's dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system's dynamics.},

To uncover a network's actual flow patterns, here we use a perturbative formalism, analytically tracking the contribution of all nodes/paths to the flow of information, exposing the rules that link structure and dynamic information flow for a broad range of nonlinear systems. We find that the diversity of flow patterns can be mapped into a single universal function, characterizing the interplay between the system's topology and its dynamics, ultimately allowing us to identify the network's main arteries of information flow. Counter-intuitively, our formalism predicts a family of frequently encountered dynamics where the flow of information avoids the hubs, favoring the network's peripheral pathways, a striking disparity between structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {It is known that the first passage time of a birth death process from n to n+1 has a completely monotone density, however, the discrete analogue for a simple random walk does not hold. In this paper, first passage times of simple random walks from n to n+1 and from 0 to n are characterized. This discrepancy between the first passage time structures of birth-death process and simple random walks is also analyzed. {\textcopyright} 1988.},
